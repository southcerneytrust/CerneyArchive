<h1>Cripps and Fenton Family</h1>
<p>The Cripps' and Fenton's have been at the heart of South Cerney village life for most
of the 20th Century. </p>

<p>E T Cripps, who donated the <a href="/scdocs/villagehallopening.htm">Village Hall</a> to South Cerney in 1925,
wrote <a href="/scdocs/ancientvillage.htm">South
Cerney - Records of an Ancient Gloucestershire Village</a> in the 1940's.</p>

<p>Raymond Fenton refers to his mother and his grandfather,&nbsp; E T Cripps, in
his introduction to Alice Mary Hadfield's <a href="/scdocs/A%20M%20Hadfield/index.htm">'Cerney
Sixty Years Ago'</a> :</p>
<P><i>&quot;He purchased South Cerney Manor in 1906, the year my mother, <FONT
style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #000080">Peggy</FONT> Cripps was born and two years
before Alice Mary was born. We changed its name around 1959 to Atkyns Manor,
after the famous Gloucestershire poet and writer Sir Robert Atkyns who once
owned the house and lived in it for a time while he was writing his famous
history of Gloucestershire. The change of name was to avoid confusion with The
Manor House, South Cerney next door.</i></P>
<P><i>My mother and Alice Mary grew up together. They were good friends and shared
many likes and dislikes. After my grandfather's death in 1957 the properties
went to my uncle, William Cripps, my mother's brother. He had one son only, Tim
who was killed in a car accident in 1963. Having no one to whom he could leave
the property, two years later he gave to me both Atkyns Manor and Brook
Cottage.</i></P>
<P><i>I was present in the Village Hall in 1982 when Alice Mary gave her talk, and
I can remember feeling deeply moved at the time as I listened to things that I
could remember as a child, and other stories that I could remember hearing from
my mother. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading again these words and will treasure
them for the rest of my life as real history. Many of the people she mentions
are now dead, but also many I can remember. In fact some I have recorded back in
the early 1960s when, with my mother I prepared a <a href="/scmm/interviews1965/interviews1965.htm">'Down
your Way'</a>, in South Cerney.&quot;</i></P>

<P align="center">Raymond Fenton</P><P>One of Raymond Fenton's many diverse
roles is as a director of TV production company, Dream Team (See <a href="http://www.dreamteamtv.co.uk">www.dreamteamtv.co.uk</a>)
who are specialists in adventure-sport coverage and factual documentaries. Dream
Team films aren't all filmed in the Himalayas or Antipodes - click <a href="bog_snorkeling.htm">here</a>
to read about one of their less exotic assignments.&nbsp;
Raymond, who with Ann Turner produced the <a href="/scmm/interviews1998/interviews1998.htm">Millennium
Self-Portrait</a> film about South Cerney, has contributed enormously to the
making of this CD-ROM.&nbsp; The addition of his video clips, scanned
photographs, and other works such as <i> <a href="/scmm/interviews1965/interviews1965.htm">Down
your Way'</a>,</i> makes the CD-ROM content far richer than it would have been
otherwise. The Cerney 1999 Committee are indebted to him for his efforts.</P>
