<H1>SOUTH CERNEY WOMEN’S INSTITUTE</H1>

</B><P>South Cerney WI, one of the earliest WIs in the country, was founded in March 1917 due to the influence of Grace Hadow, daughter of the Rev W E Hadow, vicar of South Cerney 1871-1906.  She moved to Cirencester with her mother after the death of her father, and was a founder member and president of the first Cirencester WI (July 1916).  She was an enthusiast for the training and education of women particularly through the medium of the WI.  She became Lady Denman’s deputy as Vice Chairman of the National Federation of Women’s Institutes.  She was a student at Somerville College, then became a tutor at Lady Margaret Hall and Principal of the Society of Home Students (later St Anne’s).  Having spent her formative years in the country vicarage of South Cerney she was as practical as she was academic.  Her talk to the first meeting of the South Cerney WI was on ‘the making and use of a hay box’.  In 1920 she returned to South Cerney to give a talk on ‘My American Trip’.</P>

<P>The first President of South Cerney WI was Mrs E T Cripps, of Atkyns Manor, and the Vice President was Mrs Stephens, wife of the vicar of South Cerney.  Meetings were held in the School Room in School Lane.  Later on the WI used the Scout Hut and now currently is back in School Lane in the Village Hall.</P>

<P>The subscription in 1917 was two shillings (10p) and of this 6d (2.5p) went to the County Federation.  In 1920 the Gloucestershire County Federation asked for a voluntary contribution of one shilling per member to help with county expenses.  (The annual subscription for 1998 is £13.75 and the size of the contribution to County and National funds is still a matter of debate.)</P>

<P>Throughout the decades the members of the WI have continued their programme of practical demonstrations, education and lectures for country women.  Through two world wars country women learnt through self-help and companionship how to make the best of meagre resources but they also knew how to enjoy themselves and their practical sessions were leavened, as they still are, by entertainments and outings.  The WI’s recent 80<SUP>th</SUP> birthday in 1997 was celebrated with an evening of American Line Dancing!</P>

<P>Delegates from the village have attended and voted on matters of national importance discussed at National Federation meetings.</P>

<P>100 people attended the first meeting and although there are not now so many members South Cerney WI, at over 80 years old, is still going strong.   </P></FONT></BODY>
