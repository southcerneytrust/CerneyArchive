<h1>THE ROYAL AIR FORCE</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The building of Royal Air Force South Cerney began in
1936.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In August 1937, No 3 Flying
Training School, providing advance training for pilots, moved to South Cerney from
Grantham, bringing Hawker Audax aircraft, which were replaced by Oxfords in
1938.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the outbreak of war in 1939, Headquarters No 23 Group,
which controlled advanced pilot training, also moved from Grantham to South
Cerney, where it remained until October 1946.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Meanwhile the Flying Training School was engaged in a heavy training
programme providing experience on multi-engined aircraft for newly trained
pilots.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Their Majesties King George VI and Queen Elizabeth honoured
the station with a visit on 10<sup>th</sup> February 1940.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The King inspected the training section,
whilst the Queen visited the domestic quarters and the WAAF accommodation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Later in 1940 the Duke of Kent visited the
station, and in 1941 the Duchess of Gloucester came in her capacity as Chief Commandant
of the WAAF.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Queen Mary, the Queen
Mother, also visited the station in 1941.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 1940 the station was amongst the first to be bombed by
the Luftwaffe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Bombs were dropped near
the airfield in June 1940. a few days after several hundred survivors of
Dunkirk had passed through the station.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Training became difficult, as night flying was restricted by the passage
of enemy aircraft on bombing raids to the Midlands and Merseyside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On 14<sup>th</sup> March 1942, the Flying Training School
was renamed No3 (Pilot) Advanced Flying Unit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Later in the war the unit also provided refresher and acclimatisation
training for pilots trained overseas. The unit reverted to its designation of
No 3 Flying Training School in December 1945, and in April 1946 moved to
Feltwell, being replaced by the Flying Training Command Instructors School,
which was disbanded in February 1947.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the next year the Central Link Trainer School, the
Aircrew Transit Unit and the Aircrew Allocation Unit were amongst several small
units based at South Cerney.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In March
1948, however, all these units were transferred and the station taken over by
the No 2 Flying Training School, previously at Church Lawford, whose function
was to provide basis flying training for cadet pilots.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Central Flying School (Basic) was formed at South Cerney
in May 1952, absorbing much of the then disbanded No 2 Flying Training
School.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It stayed until May 1957 before
moving to Little Rissington.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In August
1954 the Central Flying School Helicopter Squadron was formed:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the first unit in the Royal Air Force whose
specific task was to provide instruction for helicopter pilots.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>No 1 Initial Training School moved from Kirton-in-Lindsay to
South Cerney on 22<sup>nd</sup> July 1957.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Its function is to give aircrew cadets basic training as officers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1965 the Primary Flying Squadron was
introduced to give initial flying to newly-commissioned pilots.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other activities which have occupied the station from time
to time include that of being host to Cambridge and Bristol University Air
Squadrons and various Air Training Corps units for their summer camps.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1958 the Royal Air Force Gliding and
Soaring Championships were held at South Cerney.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>In 1965 the station played host to the World Gliding
Championships, which were visited by His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh.</p>
