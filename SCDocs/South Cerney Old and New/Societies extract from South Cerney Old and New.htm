<h1>PARISH SOCIETIES AND ACTIVITIES</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></b></p>

<h2>South Cerney Female Provident and Friendly Society</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the earliest village society of which there are
records.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was established in 1839 and
was registered in 1897, with the Vicar, the Rev W E Haddow as Trustee.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A copy of the rules survives, belonging to
the late Miss Kate Willis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<h2>South Cerney Amicable Society</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This was founded in 1849, and held its annual meeting at the
George Inn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1852, upwards of 100
members attended the meeting and proceeded to the parish church, headed by a
band of musicians.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After the service
‘the member then returned to the George Inn and dined in a spacious booth
erected for the occasion; but we are sorry to add that several members were
very dissatisfied with the accommodation, being obliged to dine with their hats
on, and to make use of their pocket handkerchiefs to keep out the rain, which
was penetrating through the booth in all directions.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>After the cloth was removed the usual loyal toasts were proposed
and duly responded to.’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(W &amp; G, June 1852)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<h2>Foss Inn Benefit Society</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 1852 the annual meeting was held.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A procession of fifty people went to the
church and attended a service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They
returned to an ‘excellent dinner of roast beef and plum pudding prepared by the
host, Mr and Mrs Pollard, which was very enjoyable’.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>This was held on 5<sup>th</sup> June, 1852.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(W &amp; G, June 1852)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<h2>The Women’s Institute</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Women’s Institute was started in South Cerney in 1917,
with Mrs Cripps as President.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Forty
years later, thirteen of the original members still lived in or near the
village.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A hundred people were present
at the first meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<h2>Clubs</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were at least five clubs in Cerney parish:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>‘The Miller’s’, ‘The Oak’, ‘The George’.
‘The Eliot Arms’, and ‘Horse and Groom, and ‘The Plough’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Club days were held at Whitsun and each club has its own
banner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The day started with a march to
the church, the leaders carrying big sticks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>After the church service, a return march with the Vicar leading ended at
the public house and a dinner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Dancing
followed outside the inns in a paddock with a band, side-shows, and
horse-driven roundabouts, often hired from Ambrose Smith of Ashton Keynes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When dusk came everyone played
‘Kiss-in-the-ring’ and began to pair off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Long afterwards Mr R Stait found one of the big sticks,
which was used when they marched, in a barn behind the Plough Cottage, Station
Road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was very worm-eaten.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<h2>The Girl Guides</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></u></p>

</span>There were two patrols: the Wrens with the older girls, and the Oak
patrol with the younger members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
first uniforms were made by the Guides themselves, no doubt with the help of
their parents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This Company has been going continuously for the last fifty
years without a break.</p>

was chosen as one of the five Guides from Gloucestershire to attend the
coronation of King George VI.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During these fifty years the South Cerney Guides have
entered many competitions and have done extremely well.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They have helped with innumerable activities
in the village, and they have attended camps all over the County.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They have raised money for Air Ambulances,
Army Rest Huts, Recreation Huts and Mobile Canteens among other things, and

to the older inhabitants of Cerney parish, and also parcels to the Cerney men
serving during the last war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mrs
Whiteman is the present Captain and has been for many years, and with a full
company is continuing the Guide tradition and her Company have been doing
extremely well.</p>
