<h1>SHEEP STEALING</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>South Cerney had for some years a number of expert thieves;
the area they worked spread over many miles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>They were thoroughly well organised, and it was not until 1862 that any
charge could be really laid against them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Six of them were convicted in the spring of that year, although the band
had been working for ten years previously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had a receiver who owned a horse and cart, so he was
able to take the fleeces to Fairford for sale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>They also dealt in corn and other commodities. For years it had
surprised local inhabitants that these men seemed to have plenty of money to
spend at the public house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had little trouble in removing the wool and fleeces from
barns and granaries, as they had bunches of pick locks and false keys.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They always worked well-armed, and after
conviction, fines and prison sentences, they admitted they were glad they had
been stopped, as murder would certainly have been committed the first time they
had been interfered with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The six who were at last caught and convicted in 1862 were:-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial'>John
Matthews</span></b> who was known at ‘The King of the Poachers’.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was born in Glamorganshire in 1822.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His mother was Welsh, but his father was a
Wiltshire man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He had every opportunity as a young man, but on account of
his bad habits his downward course began.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>He enlisted in the Army, but was bought out by friends.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>At the age of 21 he was convicted of
poaching on the estate of Lord Suffolk at Charlton.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>After this. By way of revenge, he, one night, scaled a wall,
entered his Lordship’s greenhouse and maliciously destroyed a large number of
vines, strewing the path with the fruit and branches.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>After a struggle he was caught, and received six months
imprisonment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1844 he was detected
poaching at Kemble, and before being overpowered by the Police officer he
stabbed this officer in the head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Apparently, although committed for trial at Gloucestershire
Assizes, he was not convicted owing to some technical point of law.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A few weeks later he was imprisoned for two
months for poaching at Chelworth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 1845 and 1846 he was convicted, again of poaching, and
was given two months imprisonment on both charges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His field of poaching and assaults seems then to have been
Gloucestershire, and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>several
convictions are recorded in different Petty Sessional divisions.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was nearly caught at Chelworth in 1854,
but escaped to the land of his birth, where he worked as a labourer in the
Welsh docks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Having got into trouble
there, he returned to Wiltshire, when he was found in 1856 at Sapperton.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He escaped again, but was eventually caught
and imprisoned for six months, having assaulted another man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 1859 he was charged with a ‘mate’ at Cirencester Petty
Sessions, but did not appear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A real
chase started then, when they were caught at the Fosse Cross Inn.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Two years imprisonment followed; in 1861
another three months for poaching at Rendcombe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having been caught with the gang of thieves in 1862 and
tried at Devises Quarter Sessions, Matthew was given fifteen months, with hard
labour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<h2><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial;text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'>Henry Johnsey</span></b><span style='text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'> was the receiver and was doubtless the worst and most
demoralized character of the whole gang.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>His house at South Cerney was used for all sorts of stolen property,
which he readily got rid of through various channels.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The fact that he was a ‘cadging’ butcher and a dealer in skins
and small lots of wool, gave him opportunities of visiting different farms and
‘taking stock’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The places were then
entered by false keys, and property of all descriptions was carried off.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 1862 he turned Queen’s Evidence, but in
spite of this he was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment.<o:p/></span></h2>

<h2><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></span></h2>

<h2><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial;text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'>George Roseblade</span></b> <span style='text-decoration:
none;text-underline:none'>was a fearless, strong man who did the heavy work of
the gang.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He always maintained that his
companions cheated him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It would appear
that he made better use of his money than the others, by taking it home to his
wife, and paying off the arrears of his club money; he did not mix with the
gang at public houses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Having been
imprisoned for felony for nine months when caught wit the gang in 1862, he
confessed, to get the sympathy of the court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>On the way to Marlborough prison to await trial, he was kept separately
from the others, but one member, Samuel Price, got a message to him, warning
him to be careful, as the worst would happen if he gave his companions away.<o:p/></span></h2>

<h2><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></span></h2>

<h2><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Two members,
Messenger and Job Johnsey, threatened Roseblade that he was to expect what
would follow!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Johnsey and Messenger
both determined men, had openly declared that if they were interfered with they
would murder a policeman, or anyone else, burying them on the spot where they
fell.<o:p/></span></h2>

<h2><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></span></h2>

<h2><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial;text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'>Henry Robbins</span></b><span style='text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'> was the gang’s expert thief.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>He was the maker of pick-locks and false keys.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He had a wife and eleven children to keep
out of his earnings, but, although he was a common laborer, it was a well-known
fact that he often spent £1 a week on drink.<o:p/></span></h2>

<h2><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></span></h2>

<h2><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>He was tried at
Gloucester Quarter Sessions in 1855 for stealing clover seed, but was acquitted.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>1857 found him imprisoned for two months as
a rogue and vagabond.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was a cruel
husband and a bad father, but notwithstanding this, his wife and family
appeared to be greatly attached to him.<o:p/></span></h2>

<h2><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></span></h2>

<h2><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Arial;text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'>Samuel Price</span></b><span style='text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'> was the only member of the gang (except Henry Johnsey)
who could write.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was first and
foremost on the nightly thieving enterprises.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>He was made paymaster and did the distributioin of the money, but it is
said that he always managed to take good care of himself.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At the Marlborough Quarter Sessions he
prepared a brief for the defence!<o:p/></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Such dishonest practices had the effect of filling the local
workhouses with women and children, who otherwise would have had their own
cottages to live in, leading honest lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is said that at the time of the breaking up, the gang
consisted of thirteen thieves, eight receivers, fifteen wives and sixty-two
children, making a total of ninety-eight to be maintained, wither wholly or
partially, out of the proceeds of stolen property.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Taking the population of the village as it was stated in 1862, as
about one thousand, there must have been approximately a tenth of the
inhabitants directly, or indirectly, preying on the neighbouring public.</p>

Bingham Library)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mrs Elsie Cole said that her father told her his
recollections of sheep-stealing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As
South Cerney is so near to the Wiltshire border it was closely concerned with
Wiltshire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sheep-stealers used to
slaughter the sheep and hide them in the big box tombs dated 1710-1755 on the
south side of the church.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They would
wait until night time and then creep back when the all clear was given and
collect the carcases and then sell the wool and the meat.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They encouraged tales and fears of ghosts to
scare people from going through the churchyard at night.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is said that sometimes these men were
caught at their evil work by local men, and they would be tied into chairs and
thrown into the brook by the villagers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The warning which the South Cerney men used when an official was about was
to ‘Baa’ like a sheep.</p>
