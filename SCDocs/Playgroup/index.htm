<h1>SOUTH CERNEY PRE-SCHOOL PLAYGROUP</h1>

<p></p>

<p>South Cerney Pre-School is a
playgroup set in a rural community and caters for children aged 2years 10
months until their entry into school. It has been in existence since 1969, but moved to its present site of
Ann Edwards School in 1988.</p>

<p>Though it maintains close links
with the school ï¿½ particularly the reception-staff, the Pre-School is an
independently run, charitable organization and relies upon the management of a
volunteer committee of parents who not only deal with the administration and
maintenance, but have also to generate funds through various activities in
order to finance the Group.

<p>There are currently 55 children

are present each day.We are also assisted by all parents on a rota-basis.</p>

<p>Our day begins at 9.00am when the
children can choose an activity from a variety prepared before they
arrive. At 9.15 we all meet for
registration and a talk about our Interest Table, the theme of which changes
weekly. Play then continues until
10.30, when the session becomes more structured, with a small group undertaking
an activity more directly aimed at writing or maths., and the remainder
enjoying a story.After this it is
snack-time, then a more physical activity, usually outside, before we have a
Group activity, such as music, prior to home time at 11.45am.</p>

<p>Ours is a very flexible day, but
using a wide range of activities we aim to meet the six Desirable Learning
Outcomes specified by the School Curriculum Assessment Authority. Thus we endeavour to give the children a
wide <b>Knowledge and Understanding of the
World</b> around them by introducing various topics and new experiences. We help their <b>Personal and Social Development </b>by encouraging independence,
sensitivity and co-operation with others in the Group. We introduce them to <b>Language and Literacy</b> by providing books, stories, rhymes and
opportunities to develop word recognition and early writing skills. For <b>Maths</b> we use a variety of sorting, matching and counting activities. Their <b>Development</b> is encouraged with the range of large and small equipment, both
inside and out, and they are given many opportunities for <b>Creative Development </b>through various mediums such as paint,
collage, pens, junk-modelling, clay, Playdough, woodwork and construction
toys. Our success in meeting these
criteria was evident in the excellent report we received after our recent
Ofsted inspection.</p>

<p>Overall we aim to produce a happy,
safe and stimulating experience for young children which will be a sound basis
for their entry into school. </p>
