style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Upper Up is a
distinct part of South Cerney and forms a separate part of the village
conservation area towards the south-western fringes of the village.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Where the High Street enters Upper-Up, the
conservation area is heralded by The Royal Oak and Royal Oak Cottage, set back
on the south side of the street.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their
setting is enhanced by the forecourt created by the ‘L’ shaped plan, and the
enclosing effect of the neighbouring building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The long honey-coloured elevation facing the High Street, is enriched by
porches, gabled dormers, brick chimney stacks, and changes in roof materials.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Royal Oak retains a domestic appearance,
like that of a large farmhouse, which complements the more rural character of
Upper-Up.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Stables
standing directly on the street, was converted to residential use in 1984, and
crucially still retains much of its original character.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Adjacent to it is, in contrast, a large Victorian
house set back from the street within generous grounds.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is only partially visible due to the high
boundary wall and mature cedar tree situated within its front garden.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its very distinctive dormer windows, tall
chimneys and Welsh slate roof are typical of the Gothic style.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On the
opposite side of the High Street, the green verge which extends for almost the
whole length of the village, approaches its westerly limit at the junction with
Jubilee Gardens, a modern housing estate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>At this point there is a slope in the verge, down towards the low
boundary walls of the properties which line the High Street, affording a view
into their well planted gardens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Looking north along The Langet, the view is channelled by the low stone
wall of Radnor and the high stone wall of Langet End, before the path bends
where it reaches Meadow View, a building distinguished by its gabled
dormers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even in this confined vista
there is a range of roofing materials which vary the scene, including Welsh
slate and simple red clay tiles in addition to local stone tiles.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Radnor is a
small detached cottage standing on the corner of The Langet.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It has modern two storey extension to the
rear that looks a little out of place, but its frontage, viewed directly from
the opposite side of the street, reveals nothing of this. Together with its
front garden, Radnor has the appearance of a gardener’s cottage.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Orchard House stands within its own grounds
occupying almost a third of this part of the conservation area, yet it hardly
features in public views.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its dense
screen of hedges and lofty pine and cypress trees are here, as elsewhere in
Upper Up, important features.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In
winter, occasional glimpses are possible through the trees, to the spacious
lawn and the house in the background.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To the south
of the road, there is a distinctive area comprising several traditional
cottages and houses, loosely distributed in plots of roughly equal size.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Interestingly, it is known that these
buildings, and the whole site, were formerly used in connection with a small
local brewery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Trees, shrubs and hedges
are also important here, framing views through to the buildings, creating a
sense of intimacy which is heightened in spring when the canopy grows to
further restrict views.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Looking west,
the pinkish appearance of Well Cottage enlivens the scene, and Rose Cottage
standing almost square to the line of the road where it veers to the north,
closes the view.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A gravel drive
bordered by high dry stone walls leads down to The Pontings, surrounded by its
former agricultural outbuildings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its
gardens to the rear comprise three former paddocks extending west from the
house to form the whole of the southern boundary of this part of the
conservation area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of much interest as
a survival of a traditional farm grouping, are two stone outbuildings to the
rear of The Pontings, a low open-fronted range and a cart shed, which face each
other across a small cobble-covered yard.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Beyond the
gardens of The Maltings, Barracks Cottage is of a quite different character to
that which prevails in this part of Upper Up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Formerly an accommodation block for brewery workers and for barley
storage, it is a prominent building crowded in by a group of more modestly
scaled buildings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Further west, Walnut
Tree Farmhouse, is a relatively large building on the western edge of this part
of the conservation area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Along with
several other cottages in the vicinity, it is reached by a private drive
branching south from the road.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Langet is
a narrow lane through the central part of Upper Up, around the grounds of
Orchard House.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It provides an
alternative route from the High Street to the north-west part of the village
and is also the only access for several cottages en-route.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are three distinct sections to The
Langet, and along each the view is curtailed by high walls or gables.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its character is dictated by the confinement
brought about by stone walls, fences and screens of trees and shrubs, and the
occasional gate or view into a garden, or down a footpath.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The northernmost section is very narrow and
lined on the south by a number of small stone cottages.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
conservation area extends a short way north along the road heading westwards
out of the village, alongside a group of traditional stone cottages, including
Sideways and Spring Cottages, before these give way to a modern housing
development. The conservation area boundary runs along the opposite, western,
side of the road and is defined by a grass verge, beyond which are hedges and
post and mesh fencing, enclosing fields and the village recreation ground.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There is a marked contrast here between the
development in Upper Up on one side of the road, and the openness of the flat
agricultural landscape and recreation ground opposite.<o:p/></span></p>
