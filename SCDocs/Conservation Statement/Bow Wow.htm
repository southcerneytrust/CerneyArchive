<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p/></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>Bow Wow, and the land alongside the River Churn, to
the east of Clarks’ Hay</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The character
and appearance of this part of the conservation area are quite different from
that of the others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Essentially, Bow
Wow is a narrow lane, bounded on one side by the River Churn and on the other
by the mill stream, passing between trees and meadows on either side, and some
secluded houses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Bow Wow is entered, at
the west end, directly off the stone bridge at the centre of the village, and
immediately provides a contrast with the quite different scene of busy village
life.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The idyllic
character continues where the river passes Little Atkyns, and both river and
lane veer slightly after passing from the initial straight stretch of Bow
Wow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Little Atkyns, its rear garden
surrounded by a more formal dry stone wall and tall hedge, is quite a
theatrical event along Bow Wow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A
semi-circular set of steps ascend directly from the river bank through a gate
on an axis with the entrance porch of the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Set back beyond the north bank of the river, it is animated by a
whole series of gazebos, miniature towers, cupolas, dove-huts and garden
follies, which can be glimpsed over its boundary wall.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After the
gardens of Downings, the next house, over the north bank of the river, the
church tower comes into view, set within the mature yew trees of the
churchyard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Here, the informal strips
of tended ground, running alongside Bow Wow, run out, and a more rural
character begins to emerge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The river
is fast moving in wet winters, but has been known to dry out to a trickle in
exceptionally dry summers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The north
bank is dense with trees and shrubs, and the water is remarkably clear and
close to the level of the lane, enhancing the intimacy of the experience.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>More distant views open up southwards, over
fields to the rear of farm buildings on Station Road, significantly of those
which form the Boxbush Farm grouping.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The quality of the riverside setting to Bow Wow, and its importance as a
rural tongue of land in the heart of the village, can be appreciated.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The visual link with Station Road is
important as it lends great coherence to the historic pattern of the village
which would largely be lost if this area was developed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Crucially it retains the agricultural
character of the village.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Bow Wow
narrows just before Lower Mill is approached, where the river is crossed by a
modern timber bridge taking a branch of the public footpath southwards into a
modern housing estate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Continuing north,
this footpath skirts around the western formal entrance of Chapter Manor before
connecting with the allotment gardens near the Church.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From this path, despite the air of privacy,
there are views of the spacious parkland which lies west of the manor, and of
the fields beyond.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Continuing
eastwards, on the south side walls define the boundary of Lower Mill, and are
soon succeeded by rubble stone outbuildings and a large boarded gate.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Lower Mill, now converted to residential
use, is a former mill and mill house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It stands facing Bow Wow and terminates the vista east from the
village.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of great significance is the
mill stream which passes under the southern portion of the building through the
original opening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Although its wheel is
missing, Lower Mill adds much character to the conservation area, and is
tangible evidence of an ancient mill mentioned in the Domesday Book.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Past the mill,
a tall evergreen hedge backed by the high boundary wall of Chapter Manor’s
grounds prevents any view north, and attention is therefore focussed onto the
vista along Bow Wow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The river,
surrounded by trees and shrubs, animates and enhances the whole scene,
particularly the garden setting of the south and west faces of Lower Churn, as
this house is reached.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the north side
the water is almost motionless, while on the south it is fast flowing until it
can be seen joining the mill stream at a noisy confluence a short distance to
the south.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After crossing
the river by a small humped-back bridge, an irregular open space is entered,
contained by the north-facing frontage of Lower Churn, and the high boundary
walls of Chapter Manor, resulting in an intimate courtyard-like
atmosphere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is enhanced by numerous
trees, grass verges, and the splay of another entrance into Chapter Manor and
the open front garden of Lower Churn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Chapter Manor plays a significant role in the conservation area at this
point, as it exudes the grandeur of a large house, but it is also discreet
behind its walls and screen of trees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>There is a dovecote built into the gable end of the Manor, and, at
times, many white doves can be seen roosting or in flight.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Other details such as the distinctive
weather vane, numerous chimneys of varying styles and materials, and a delicate
metal-framed greenhouse also enrich the scene.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Beyond the manor, is a range of stone-built stables, small outbuildings
and large barns, with a mixture of roofing materials, and a range of boundary
treatments: dry-stone walling, timber fences and gates.<o:p/></span></p>

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As the
embankment leading up to the railway bridge is climbed, distant views over flat
fields open up to the north, criss-crossed by timber fences.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To the south, there are views back into the
rear garden of Lower Churn through the dense copse which bounds three sides of
a small field.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The climb to the bridge
passes through an avenue of tall thin poplar trees which permit views either
side over the embankment.<o:p/></span></p>

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The disused
railway bridge is a substantial brick structure standing at the eastern fringe
of the conservation area, crossing the line of the former Midland and South
Western Junction Railway, built in 1891.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>From its apex there are good views back to the village, and northwards
over a flat agricultural landscape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To
the south views are quite a contrast, being limited by a dense copse.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Looking down off the bridge there is a
scruffy area of bushes, pools and muddy paths, which let down the quality of
the bridge itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This bridge is a
striking symbol of the Railway Age, each of its ten arches being articulated by
piers having two segmental transverse arches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The whole effect is surprisingly delicate and unexpected, and typical of
the engineering aesthetic of the age.<o:p/></span></p>
