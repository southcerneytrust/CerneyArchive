    <h1>Extract from South Cerney Conservation Area Statement:</h1>

    <h2>Bow Wow, and the land alongside the River Churn, to the east of Clarks&#8217;
    Hay</h2>

     <p>The character and appearance of this part of the conservation area are quite
    different from that of the others.&nbsp; Essentially, Bow Wow is a narrow lane,
    bounded on one side by the River Churn and on the other by the mill stream, passing
    between trees and meadows on either side, and some secluded houses.&nbsp; Bow Wow is
    entered, at the west end, directly off the stone bridge at the centre of the village,
    and immediately provides a contrast with the quite different scene of busy village
    life.</p>

 
    <p>The idyllic character continues where the river passes Little Atkyns, and both
    river and lane veer slightly after passing from the initial straight stretch of Bow
    Wow.&nbsp; Little Atkyns, its rear garden surrounded by a more formal dry stone wall
    and tall hedge, is quite a theatrical event along Bow Wow.&nbsp; A semi-circular set
    of steps ascend directly from the river bank through a gate on an axis with the
    entrance porch of the house.&nbsp; Set back beyond the north bank of the river, it is
    animated by a whole series of gazebos, miniature towers, cupolas, dove-huts and
    garden follies, which can be glimpsed over its boundary wall.</p>

    <p>After the gardens of Downings, the next house, over the north bank of the river,
    the church tower comes into view, set within the mature yew trees of the
    churchyard.&nbsp; Here, the informal strips of tended ground, running alongside Bow
    Wow, run out, and a more rural character begins to emerge.&nbsp; The river is fast
    moving in wet winters, but has been known to dry out to a trickle in exceptionally
    dry summers.&nbsp; The north bank is dense with trees and shrubs, and the water is
    remarkably clear and close to the level of the lane, enhancing the intimacy of the
    experience.&nbsp; More distant views open up southwards, over fields to the rear of
    farm buildings on Station Road, significantly of those which form the Boxbush Farm
    grouping.&nbsp; The quality of the riverside setting to Bow Wow, and its importance
    as a rural tongue of land in the heart of the village, can be appreciated.&nbsp; The
    visual link with Station Road is important as it lends great coherence to the
    historic pattern of the village which would largely be lost if this area was
    developed.&nbsp; Crucially it retains the agricultural character of the village.</p>

   <p>Bow Wow narrows just before Lower Mill is approached, where the river is crossed
    by a modern timber bridge taking a branch of the public footpath southwards into a
    modern housing estate.&nbsp; Continuing north, this footpath skirts around the
    western formal entrance of Chapter Manor before connecting with the allotment gardens
    near the Church.&nbsp; From this path, despite the air of privacy, there are views of
    the spacious parkland which lies west of the manor, and of the fields beyond.</p>

   
    <p>Continuing eastwards, on the south side walls define the boundary of Lower Mill,
    and are soon succeeded by rubble stone outbuildings and a large boarded gate.&nbsp;
    Lower Mill, now converted to residential use, is a former mill and mill house.&nbsp;
    It stands facing Bow Wow and terminates the vista east from the village.&nbsp; Of
    great significance is the mill stream which passes under the southern portion of the
    building through the original opening.&nbsp; Although its wheel is missing, Lower
    Mill adds much character to the conservation area, and is tangible evidence of an
    ancient mill mentioned in the Domesday Book.</p>

   
    <p>Past the mill, a tall evergreen hedge backed by the high boundary wall of Chapter
    Manor&#8217;s grounds prevents any view north, and attention is therefore focussed
    onto the vista along Bow Wow.&nbsp; The river, surrounded by trees and shrubs,
    animates and enhances the whole scene, particularly the garden setting of the south
    and west faces of Lower Churn, as this house is reached.&nbsp; On the north side the
    water is almost motionless, while on the south it is fast flowing until it can be
    seen joining the mill stream at a noisy confluence a short distance to the south.</p>

   
    <p>After crossing the river by a small humped-back bridge, an irregular open space is
    entered, contained by the north-facing frontage of Lower Churn, and the high boundary
    walls of Chapter Manor, resulting in an intimate courtyard-like atmosphere.&nbsp; It
    is enhanced by numerous trees, grass verges, and the splay of another entrance into
    Chapter Manor and the open front garden of Lower Churn.&nbsp; Chapter Manor plays a
    significant role in the conservation area at this point, as it exudes the grandeur of
    a large house, but it is also discreet behind its walls and screen of trees.&nbsp;
    There is a dovecote built into the gable end of the Manor, and, at times, many white
    doves can be seen roosting or in flight.&nbsp; Other details such as the distinctive
    weather vane, numerous chimneys of varying styles and materials, and a delicate
    metal-framed greenhouse also enrich the scene.&nbsp; Beyond the manor, is a range of
    stone-built stables, small outbuildings and large barns, with a mixture of roofing
    materials, and a range of boundary treatments: dry-stone walling, timber fences and
    gates.</p>

   
    <p>As the embankment leading up to the railway bridge is climbed, distant views over
    flat fields open up to the north, criss-crossed by timber fences.&nbsp; To the south,
    there are views back into the rear garden of Lower Churn through the dense copse
    which bounds three sides of a small field.&nbsp; The climb to the bridge passes
    through an avenue of tall thin poplar trees which permit views either side over the
    embankment.</p>

   
    <p>The disused railway bridge is a substantial brick structure standing at the
    eastern fringe of the conservation area, crossing the line of the former Midland and
    South Western Junction Railway, built in 1891.&nbsp; From its apex there are good
    views back to the village, and northwards over a flat agricultural landscape.&nbsp;
    To the south views are quite a contrast, being limited by a dense copse.&nbsp;
    Looking down off the bridge there is a scruffy area of bushes, pools and muddy paths,
    which let down the quality of the bridge itself.&nbsp; This bridge is a striking
    symbol of the Railway Age, each of its ten arches being articulated by piers having
    two segmental transverse arches.&nbsp; The whole effect is surprisingly delicate and
    unexpected, and typical of the engineering aesthetic of the age.</p>
