into School Lane at its north corner with Silver Street is defined by the first
of a terrace of well-preserved eighteenth-century cottages.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A dense evergreen hedge on the opposite side
of the road screens modern development and thereby focuses the view onto the
series of traditional cottages which line the northern edge.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The modest, but beautifully planted and well
tended, gardens of No 2, Highnam Cottages, Berkeley House and Vine Cottage, do
much to enhance the character and appearance of this part of the conservation
area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A noticeable and distinctive
feature here is the use of large Cotswold stone tiles set vertically into the
ground to form the boundaries of these gardens.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Looking back are views of the well preserved rear elevations of
Highnam Cottages, particularly the distinctive treatment of their painted
window and door joinery.<o:p/></span></p>

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Proceeding
further into School Lane, The Old School, occupying a prominent position on the
north side, is a large but simple stone building in nineteenth-century Gothic
style.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is somewhat let down by its
setting, being fronted by a large concrete covered forecourt and enclosed by a
high stone wall and galvanised steel railings.<o:p/></span></p>

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The lane
narrows where Clover Cottage and The Forge stand on opposite sides, before the
building lines open again, revealing the space ahead centred on the River Churn
and the small green which fronts the Village Hall.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>This space has a very special and distinctive character quite
unlike any other part of the village.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Looking back eastwards from the Village Hall, Silver Street cannot be
seen, due to the view being blocked by cottages on either side.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This creates an impression of being in an
entirely separate settlement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
contrast between the more built up east section of School Lane, and the
openness of this space, with its green verges, trees, shrubs and flowering plants
interspersed by staddle-stones is important.<o:p/></span></p>

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At this point
in its course, the river is narrow, fast-moving but silent, due to the gentle
undulating nature of the riverbed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Emerging from behind The Forge, its arcing course bisects the space
before it splits into two branches, creating an island linked to School Lane by
a distinctive narrow hump-backed bridge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>There are several sets of stone steps descending into the river on its
southern bank, which may have been used for washing clothes by the occupants of
the nearby cottages in the past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its
principal branch veers to the north and quickly disappears from view beyond the
high dry stone boundary wall of Brook House, whilst the southern branch narrows
to a point where it enters a culvert under the lane near Upper Mill House, and
also passes from view.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The cottages
here are well preserved and traditional in character, some in short terraces,
and others detached.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A striking feature
of these cottages is their scale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their
low roofs, tiny hipped and gabled dormers, and diminutive windows and doors,
and even the gardens, shrubs and plants appears as if in miniature.<o:p/></span></p>

buildings situated on the north side of School Lane are of a range of
architectural styles and materials, also playing an important role in shaping
the character of the space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Village
Hall, the front part of which was formerly a barn, is a rubble stone building
of some significance within the village, particularly because of its
distinctive thatched roof.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Brook House,
is large, ashlar-faced and three storey, in the restrained classical style of
the Georgian period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Together with
Upper Mill House, it stands square on to School Lane enclosing this edge of the
space.<o:p/></span></p>

of this part of the conservation area comprises of the island formed by the two
branches of the river and the two lanes and paths which extend westward along
the outer banks of the river.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
island, on which stand several houses, is connected to the surrounding area by
small bridges, where views of the river and the sound which it creates are ever
present.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To the south a footpath skirts
along the riverbank lending an almost moat-like nature to the island.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A group of modern houses arranged about an
open space at Millside, echoes the intimacy and the established riverside
setting of the grouping of buildings by the Village Hall.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Once beyond Brook House, the northern lane
follows the course of the river, bordered by high dry stone walls, but softened
by thin grass verges, until the scene opens out into a rural landscape, where
allotment gardens, and then fields, extend into the distance.<o:p/></span></p>
