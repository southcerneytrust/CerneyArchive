style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Station Road
and the High Street together constitute South Cerney’s principal east-west
route.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Distinguished as a long wide
thoroughfare, particularly in such a village setting, these streets are made
even more remarkable by the wide grass verge which extends for almost their
entire length on the north side, and the series of deep ditches cut into it
which occur for a part of Station Road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The presence of numerous traditional buildings of historic significance,
important focal points such as the medieval cross, and views over open farmland
to other parts of the village also lend this part of the village a special
character and appearance.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Entering the
village from the east, Boxbush Farm, with its ancillary outbuildings and
fields, and Boxbush Cottage, is a significant grouping of agricultural and
traditional buildings on the same side as the verge.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>They play an important role in defining the character of this
part of the village.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Both the farmhouse
and cottage retain their original traditional detailing, particularly
noticeable in the door and window joinery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Looking north from Station Road, distant views are possible through gaps
between farm buildings, and over fences, gates and stone walls to open fields,
and the church and tree-lined Bow Wow beyond.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The survival of such a substantial farm and swathe of agricultural land
a short distance from the village centre is important.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The crucial value of this area, between
Station Road, Clark’s Hay and Bow Wow, has been described above.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The farm
grouping is separated from the road by the wide grass verge, which is a
significant feature of the whole length of Station Road and the High
Street.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At this point the grass verge
narrows somewhat before becoming wider again towards the village centre.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Formerly the route of a tributary of the
River Churn which followed the line of Station Road, the verge contains several
deep ditches linked by culverted sections passing beneath grassed areas.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The ditches, which today are generally dry,
and only occasionally flooded, would have, prior to the development of the
nearby gravel pits, flooded far more frequently.<o:p/></span></p>

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On the
opposite side of the road, is a very long row of cottages, many dating from the
sixteenth century, and therefore among the earliest domestic buildings in the
village.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Despite the loss of three
central cottages, and their replacement with Georgian detached houses, the row
is a remarkable survival.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its strong
architectural presence is the result of its length, and the series of gabled
dormer windows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It totally encloses the
southern side of the street and, together with the Boxbush Farm grouping, creates
a spatial quality which is further enhanced by the grass verge, several
hawthorn trees and the ditches.<o:p/></span></p>

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Towards the
centre of the village, the street scape becomes wider where Englefield, a large
double-fronted nineteenth-century house, is set back within its own grounds on
the south side.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Immediately beyond is
the great expanse of the storage yard fronting the CAMAS building materials
factory, which occupies a large portion of the southern side of this part of the
road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Adjoining the conservation area,
it is a surprising feature within the heart of such an otherwise traditional
looking village, and an emphatic symbol of the importance of the local sand and
gravel industry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The harshness of this
industrialised scene is tempered by the low wall, grass verge and row of mature
deciduous trees, which echo the appearance of the north side of the road.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Also, adjoining the factory, Ham House, a
substantial Georgian building, stands well back from the south side of Station
Road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is an important landmark building
which has an impressive front elevation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Running down to it is the intimate Ham Lane, continuing south to reveal
a series of charming agricultural outbuildings.<o:p/></span></p>

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A medieval
cross stands on a stepped plinth within a triangular island of grass, formed by
the road at the busy junction of Station Road, High Street and Clark’s
Hay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The space around this junction is
enclosed by a loose arrangement of traditional buildings, set back from the
pavement within their own gardens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Prominent among these is South Cerney Farmhouse and its surviving
outbuildings, no longer in use as a farm, but another reminder of the village’s
agricultural heritage.<o:p/></span></p>

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Old Post
Office, Thrift Cottage and Manor Cottage are further west, on the north side of
the High Street .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At this point the
grass verge gives way to the forecourt of a former garage, which has a loose
gathering of outbuildings of a domestic scale, built of a mixture of
materials.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These evoke the past
activities which would have taken place at this part of the village.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The agricultural outbuildings and land to
the rear, which can be seen from Meadow Way and Churn Close, are again a
reminder of the former prevalence of farming within the village.<o:p/></span></p>

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This part of
the conservation area reaches its western limit at the junction of High Street
and Broadway Lane, where the War Memorial stands on a small grass island in the
road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The grass verge is still
prominent here, although from this point on it narrows and loses its impact.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A delightful feature of the north side of
the High Street are the raised gardens of The Cottage and Ivy Cottage, which
may have been ‘kitchen gardens’ in the days when self sufficiency existed
throughout the village.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These gardens,
against a backdrop of traditional stone cottages, provide much greenery and
depth and lend an idyllic village atmosphere to the setting of the High
Street.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The conservation area ends at
Pike House and Corner Cottage on the south side of the road, before the
streetscape gives way on either side to more recent development.<o:p/></span></p>
