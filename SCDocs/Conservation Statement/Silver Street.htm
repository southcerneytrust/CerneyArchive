style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Upon entering
the village from the north along its principal approach road from Cirencester,
the imposing Berry Farm heralds the northern limit of the conservation area. It
is now surrounded by residential development, but nevertheless, being a series
of sizeable agricultural buildings immediately adjacent to the eastern side of
the road, is a feature of profound importance to the character of this part of
the village.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It brings active
agricultural atmosphere right into the village, giving an indication of the
farming past of South Cerney.<o:p/></span></p>

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Spaces between
the hay store, cart shed and stone barn permit views through to the other farm
buildings, and beyond over an open agricultural landscape.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Typical of many such groupings, a diverse
range of structures and building materials have been utilised, including
barrel-vaulted steel-framed structures covered with corrugated iron and
substantial Cotswold stone built buildings with many chimneys and gables of
varying heights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most notable of these
are the late sixteenth century farmhouse itself and the principal barn which
stand prominently, parallel with the road.<o:p/></span></p>

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Further views
south towards the centre of the village are restricted at this point by the
bend in the road and the visual bottleneck created by the gable-ends of Berry
Farmhouse and Lime Tree Cottage on the opposite side of the road.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The only hint at what lies beyond is the
view over the farm buildings to the impressive chimneys of Edwards College, a
row of almshouses.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Once beyond
Berry Farm the road veers away to the right, and eventually disappears between
another bottleneck created by two prominent buildings: Liddell House and Gable
Cottage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This sharp narrowing and
widening of Silver Street creates a richness of spaces on either side of this
section, the architecture also being very varied in character.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Just before the bottleneck, and set well
back from the road, is Century House, a large Victorian stuccoed villa in
generous grounds with many mature trees easily seen over its close-boarded
boundary fence, this contrasting with the more traditional buildings standing
alongside the verge.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Set back on
the opposite side of the road is the more prominent Edwards College. Founded in
1838 as a row of twelve almshouses, it is an unusually tall and impressive
Gothic style building standing at right angles to the road.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its long front elevation, seen on a glancing
view, has tall gables and distinctive chimneys.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It has a splendid prospect from the broad terrace, south to a
swath of fields allowing an undisturbed view of the church, Chapter Manor and
rows of mature trees beyond, south, towards the centre of the village.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is a very important open space.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In contrast, the end part of Edwards
College, facing the street, has an intimate, well-planted garden.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This adjoins a point where a number of lanes
and tracks converge at a single wide opening on the east side of the road, each
having stone gate piers, some ornate – a grouping which looks a little odd.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Continuing
along Silver Street, views become more restricted by the high dry stone walls,
which also emphasise the curve of the road at this point.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After passing Liddell House and Gable
Cottage, the verges widen and a view opens up to the bridge over the River
Churn and the centre of the village.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The scene is enlivened by many chimneys, roofs, gables and gardens of
the buildings which line Silver Street, creating a sense of arrival.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Turning back, Liddell House closes the view
northwards up Silver Street.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The more
modest character of the group of cottages on the east side of the road,
opposite Liddell House, provide contrast, their gardens, visible over the low
dry stone boundary wall, full of shrubs and flowering plants, creating a strongly
domestic scene.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the opposite side of
the street, this character is taken up by other cottages with small front
gardens behind hedges and low dry stone walls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The cottages are traditional in their detailing and architectural form,
some having hipped dormers interrupting the deep projecting eaves line.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One, Orchis, is distinguished by a
two-storey wing which originally garaged the village charabanc.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It adds much to the character of the street,
especially as some of its exterior joinery retains the original traditional
colour scheme of blue-grey frames and white details.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On the same
side of the street, Timbrell’s Close is a modern infill development, although
has been designed to harmonise with surrounding cottages.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Cotswold Cottage, one of the most
interesting buildings here, is a hybrid of the traditional cottage vernacular
and more polished architectural detailing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>A gap between Cotswold Cottage and The Cottage affords a glimpse of a
builder’s yard and workshop buildings to the rear, revealing the working
activity taking place behind the street frontage.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>From this point southwards to the bridge there are a series of
well-preserved traditional cottages of modest scale, standing back from the
road behind the wide verge.<o:p/></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:36.0pt 54.0pt 72.0pt 162.0pt'><span

style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Contrasting
with these, and richer in architectural detail, is the early nineteenth century
Silver Street House on the east side of the street.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Adjoining Brook Cottage, a small privet hedge, sitting atop a low
dry stone wall, provides a degree of privacy, and a wrought iron gate permits
views through into the gardens of both properties, containing several mature
trees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At this point, Silver Street
widens dramatically, where it is joined by Church Lane and School Lane.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The overall character of the space is
difficult to describe although more of the character of a square than elsewhere
in the village.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There is clearly a
marked contrast between the stature of houses on the east side of the street,
and the modest vernacular buildings on the west.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Of the more imposing buildings, the seventeenth century Atkyns
Manor is the most important, set back from the street behind a wide gravelled
area, delicately detailed wrought-iron railings (including tall ashlar
gate-piers) screening a lawn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Here, there
are several other large houses standing in their own grounds, some on the
street frontage and others beyond nearer to the Church.<o:p/></span></p>
