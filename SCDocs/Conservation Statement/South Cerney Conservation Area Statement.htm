valley, known in the Saxon Chronicles as the debatable lands, fell within the
border region of the two kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex, and was therefore
potentially unstable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, by late
Saxon times, evidence for a settlement becomes more substantial.<span

occupation and the importance of the parish, referring to it as the fertile
lands of Cerney.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Domesday survey
shows that the land was already organised under a manorial system, and was the
Archbishop of Canterburys most valuable Gloucestershire possession, with
farming as the principal activity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By
the beginning of the thirteenth century, the parish was divided up into three
estates, resulting in the establishment within the village of three manors:
Chapter Manor, Atkyns Manor, and The Manor, two of which belonged to religious
orders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As each estate required its own
army of workers, this had a profound effect on the growth of South Cerneys
population.<o:p/></span></p>

village had a fulling mill, which helped the production of high quality

flourished between the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, with a
growing rural industrial economy in addition to its important agricultural
activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Perhaps reflecting the
prosperity of the time, the Church of All Hallows was extensively altered and
