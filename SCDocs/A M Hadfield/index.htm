<P>Preface</P>

<P>The South Cerney Trust has great pleasure in publishing this talk, given at the Village Hall in 1982, by its founder the late Mrs A M Hadfield.  We are indebted to Mr Charles Hadfield for making available her notes, preparing the script for publication and for providing the two photographs.  Apart from minor editing, her words have been left exactly as she spoke them.  At Mr Hadfield�s suggestion, we have asked Mr Raymond Fenton to write the introduction.</P>

<P>Introduction</P>

<P>I can honestly say that I have known Alice Mary all my life until she died in 1989. You see I have a special claim. I was born in South Cerney in 1941. Not just in South Cerney, but in Atkyns Manor where we live. I can go even further than that. I was born in the bedroom that my wife and I use as a bedroom now. At the start of her memoirs, Alice Mary mentions Brook Cottage in Silver Street where she grew up, and to where her father came on retirement. Brook Cottage is the house next to mine and was also owned by my maternal grandfather. He purchased South Cerney Manor in 1906, the year my mother, Peggy Cripps was born and two years before Alice Mary was born. We changed its name around 1959 to Atkyns Manor, after the famous Gloucestershire poet and writer Sir Robert Atkyns who once owned the house and lived in it for a time while he was writing his famous history of Gloucestershire. The change of name was to avoid confusion with The Manor House, South Cerney next door.</P>
<P>My mother and Alice Mary grew up together. They were good friends and shared many likes and dislikes. After my grandfather's death in 1957 the properties went to my uncle, William Cripps, my mother's brother. He had one son only, Tim who was killed in a car accident in 1963. Having no one to whom he could leave the property, two years later he gave to me both Atkyns Manor and Brook Cottage.</P>
<P>I was present in the Village Hall in 1982 when Alice Mary gave her talk, and I can remember feeling deeply moved at the time as I listened to things that I could remember as a child, and other stories that I could remember hearing from my mother. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading again these words and will treasure them for the rest of my life as real history. Many of the people she mentions are now dead, but also many I can remember. In fact some I have recorded back in the early 1960s when, with my mother I prepared a "Down your Way, in South Cerney". These recordings I still have in my archives and will treasure forever.</P>

<P>Alice Mary was a good and faithful friend, not only to my mother, but also to myself and I was very sorry when she died in 1989. Her son Alec came over from Canada with his wife, for the funeral, and it gave me great pleasure to have them staying with me, though unfortunately my wife was at that time in hospital. Perhaps my passing farewell was that I was able to play the organ for the service. I was also able to renew friendship with her daughter Molly at the time, who I hadn't seen for many years.</P>
<P>These notes about South Cerney must form an important part of the documentary history of the village, and I sincerely hope that all those who read them, will get as much pleasure as I do reading them over and over again.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>My origins in South Cerney are with my grandmother. She came as widow of a clergyman, Albert Goodwin, to No.1 1 The College in the 1880s. She had five children, but I think only my mother Molly was a young child in Cerney. She went to a clergy daughters' school. All the family were devoted to their mother, and two sons Harry and Dick, both schoolmasters, were well known in the village. Harry played in the cricket team, as well as for the county. No. 11 The College was a place of happy gatherings in its little rooms and veranda.</P>

<P>My mother married her cousin Henry Smyth, a soldier, in the Cheshire Regiment, who spent most of his active service life in the Middle East and India. They were married in Cerney Church on November 30th 1905. My brother John was born in Meshed, Persia, but for my arrival my mother took rooms in the present Orchis, in Silver Street, then called The Nook. I was christened in Cerney church. After two spells in India we came home to Cerney at the threat of war, and my mother took a lease of Brook Cottage in Silver Street, where I grew up, and my father came to live on retirement. Some time after his death my mother moved into Silver Street House (then called Glendermott) which I inherited in 1949, after I had married Charles Hadfield in 1945. So I am a genuine Silver Streeter.</P>

<P>My brother and I went to a little boarding school for young ones like us at Little Faringdon Common, and I can remember driving there in the pony-trap owned by Mr. Tom Painter the blacksmith - front seat, and back side seats. I remember the cob, Prince, and being lifted up to stick a bunch of elder leaves into his head band to keep off the flies.</P>

<P>A quick look at the village itself, sixty years ago. The north-south road from Cirencester - there was no airfield - came in through fields and hedges past the canal lock house and over the Thames &amp; Severn Canal by a brick skew bridge. This was quite safe because you could hear the hooves of a horse coming up the skew in plenty of time. You went on under the Midland &amp; South Western Junction railway bridge, which had an iron trough and was always called the tin bridge. High hawthorn hedges on each side, wide grass verges, past the tumps  of the old Castle ground, to Webb's Farm, that admirable old building still keeping the threshing barn and great doors on the road, then The College, a glimpse of the church, and the village began.</P>

<P>Silver Street was much the same, except that the green verges were wider, more established. A line of rowans stood down the middle of each. A trio of small cottages stood between Silver Street House and Brook Cottage garden entrance. Atkyns Manor, Church Lane and a small shop led on to the bridge.</P>

<P>This feature was narrower than now, more defined in the character of a passage over the water, Hay-wains and farm-carts could use it, and traction-engines for road work. But the needs of motor traffic had not arrived. The bridge was a gathering or viewing place for young folk on summer evenings, boys leaning on one wall and girls on the other. Just enough sense of screen from cottage windows.</P>

<P>The River Churn divides here to provide a mill stream down Bow Wow for Lower Mill, held in its bed at Cerney bridge by flood hatches. The river turns down to form the pool and flows on under one arch of the bridge on the lower side of the road down Bow Wow.</P>

<P>Flood-hatches used to stand up across the upper level to keep water in the mill stream. Men in gum-boots used to raise or lower these hatches to keep a required level. Villagers often balanced across barelegged to rescue some item or unfortunate cat, caught on the hatches. I remember balancing across for fun, hanging on to the hatch posts, with Peggy Cripps, late mother of Raymond Fenton. This was of course forbidden. Wet weather made the water foam splendidly under and over the hatches, and fill up the pool. As children we used to hang about hoping for a flood, which often came along in winter, and spread gently down School Lane or even across Silver Street. Women would sweep it away with brooms. I never heard of real damage, or water in Highnam Cottages. The rest of the year the pool, not then walled up in front, was a valuable drinking place for animals being driven to Cirencester market - and of course for shallow paddling and summer pleasures, as at the other end of School Lane by the forge. My brother and I planted the young oak tree on the land above the pool.</P>

<P>The whole side of the pool had a fine hawthorn hedge where the may bloomed white and smelled delicious in the sun. Behind it was a big garden, and on the road in School Lane was a low, deep-gabled cottage with a shed or two, where Fred and Polly Griffiths lived. Polly had twisted spiral glass ornaments, a well-designed table and kitchen pieces on her mantelshelf. I remember Fred Griffiths as Church Clerk, but he had many pursuits. The garden joined up with the forge property. There was no bridge over the river, nor bungalows across it.</P>

<P>The forge was of course a leading feature of the village - for shoeing, repairing or even making parts of implements, wheel-bands, ploughshares - or smaller household implements, garden or horse harness items. The first blacksmith I knew was Tom Painter, and after him his son Arthur, the last smith in Cerney. As kids we loved to hear the hammer sounds, and watch the glowing fire and sparks. Hanging about round the forge was forbidden, as smiths don't like it; nor do horses. But children did what they could.</P>

<P>We were not supposed to potter about the village. We had homes, and if we went to shops or friends we went and came back. Playing on the street was despised, at every social level. It carried a sense of idleness and curiosity which everyone detested. Only the water's edge might be excepted.</P>

<P>At the upper end of School Lane the river divides again, and the mill-stream is cut to work Upper Mill. This is the only mill I remember working. By then it had ceased to mill grain, and become a saw-mill. The owner, Mr. Whiting, used the power of the mill-wheel's fall to generate electricity for lighting his house, the brick house upon the hill behind the mill. He cut timber and made toys in the mill for a short time, and then had a disastrous fire which wrecked its interior.</P>

<P>What we know as the Village Hall was then an old barn on a big stretch of green. The school building was as now, but had a pretty little bell frame on top, and good stone houses behind it for master and mistress. The school bell just before 9 o'clock was a daily feature, and the children did their exercises and played and shrieked in the yard. This was part of the day's life.</P>

<P>Over the bridge into Clark's Hay there was the butcher's shop and slaughter house, the Eliot Arms and on a long stretch of green a beautiful house with along barn roof behind it, beyond the Eliot Arms. Later Miss Lane had her sweet shop in the front room. Opposite was another wide stretch of green in front of the Congregational Chapel and the Old George, (no silver tree then, for it was not planted until 1935, to mark the Silver jubilee of King George V's accession in 1935), cottages and one shop. After that the lane was all green verges and hedges. On the west side the big meadow stretched to the middle of High Street and to Upper Up. Meadow Way and River Way are now built on it.</P>

<P>The Methodist Chapel and bakehouse opposite led to the wide area of the old Cross - a small farm house well back on each arm of the cross roads, a big spread of green, no path across it separating the roads, no bus shelter. There was then no gravelling thereabouts. Ham Lane led to a watery area, but rubbish had long dried up the old track. I loved it because it went nowhere, but to fields, and birds and silence. You could potter about.</P>

<P>From The Cross the road ran pretty straight to the railway station, on to Cerney Wick, and so to other villages. The other way it ran up High Street, past little Broadway Lane, the Royal Oak, Tanners, whose old name was Barston House, and a cluster of old buildings where the brewery used to be, to Upper Up and Upper Upper Up, and away to Ashton Keynes, or Siddington, or the Kemble road and station.</P>

<P>That was roughly the layout of the village. Cerney Wick was 2 1/2 miles south, with no lakes then, but tiny lanes and high hedges like a Grimm's story tale setting, with snug-looking houses. The river and the canal were close in, and the mill, the Crown Inn, and Cerney Wick's own church. You would never guess that the main road lay so close behind it. The children had to walk to Cerney School, but otherwise Cerney Wick was very independent.</P>

<P>All our white roads in Cerney and in Wick were bordered by deep wide ditches where streams ran in winter and wild flowers grew in spring and summer, marsh marigolds, fool's parsley, comfrey, willow herb. There were green verges on either side, and brick and stone footways across them. The verges were not private property, but everyone's. When my family lived in Brook Cottage and had the idea of keeping a donkey for me to ride, we thought it a simple idea to tether the donkey to one of the rowan trees on the green verge outside the house. He would be handy, and could feed. Next afternoon the policeman knocked on the door. He explained that the verge was not our property just because it was outside our house. We could feed the donkey there while one of us held his rope, but no tethering and leaving him. Verges were not private.</P>

<P>There were no planted trees or flowers on any verges except the rowans on Silver Street, which you can see in old paintings. They had rough treatment when the first electricity lines were laid under the verges along the street. They died one by one in a year or two.</P>

<P>Cerney was well provided with shops. We did general shopping from two shops one on each side of the bridge, where they are now. Mr. Dorling's is much enlarged from the days of Sidney Hicks. Mr. Hicks was also in the painting and decorating line, and had very pretty daughters, one who helped in the shop, and still lives in the village. The
other shop was Mr. Luker's, where is now the new Post Office in much enlarged premises. Mr. Luker, in his enveloping always-clean white apron, his bald head, exact speech and stately walk, was a figure of enormous respect in the village. He was on the Church Council, and managed the business side of the Flower Show, a formidable job. His family also still live in Cerney.
<P> Between the Eliot Arms and the stream was our butcher's shop, and the slaughter-house at right angles to it where the shop is today, with a door and steps down to clean, running water. Butcher Ewer, a big, high-coloured man with black hair and blue and white apron, seemed to me a tremendous figure. He walked stiffly and used a tall thumb stick when he drove a few big lambs up Bow Wow, over the bridge and down to the slaughter- house. My mother used to hustle me over the bridge when I wanted to stroke the lambs. Of course Mr. Ewer was a judge of horseflesh, and drove an impressive bay cob in his trap. He stabled the cob and trap in the yard on Silver Street next to the three cottages below Silver Street House. When my husband and I moved in to Silver Street House, whose property included the yard, we found the name 'Butcher Ewer's Yard' in the deeds, and kept it gladly, to remember a notable village character.</P>

<P>The Post Office was in High Street, next door to the Co-Op stores where most of that end of the village shopped. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Johnson and their children lived there and ran both establishments. The Co-Op had its own baker, Mr. Mustoe. The Co-Op has closed, and the Post Office has moved, but the family still live in High Street. The Morgans, a versatile family, I think ran a shop as well as a bakery for a while. Mrs. Cook at the Pike House sold sweets. In a little cottage behind the old Cross was a cobbler, a village shoemaker.</P>

<P>For other shopping our transport to and from Cirencester, or Ciceter as we called it, was feet, or bikes, with a cab for the elderly, ordered I think from the town.</P>

<P>We had a number of useful deliveries. We mostly took our meat money when we bought it, but not the Sunday joint which a boy brought in a basket under a white cloth from Mr. Ewer. Only English meat, and mostly from local markets was offered. Milk came every morning. Arthur Greening, very short, ginger hair, apron, drove a pony cart, standing up with the brightly polished brass churns, a big dipper ladle to fill the pint or quart measure. You could leave a jug at the door or go out to the cart with it. He must have filled the churns at one of the farms after early milking.</P>

<P>Bread was baked by more than one baker. At different times in the morning your chosen man would come to the back door, big basket covered with a cloth, have a chat and leave the bread. I think we settled up weekly. I remember two or three little account books on the kitchen dresser, 'not to be moved'!</P>

<P>A carrier used to drive his cart to and from Cirencester and do small purchases and bring out goods. He had candles in his cart - lights in winter, and I remember watching, for my granny, for the wavering lights on his cart coming slowly up the back way of the College, delivering at one or two houses.</P>

<P>Occasionally a man got off the train from Swindon and came round with a green rush basket containing fresh fish. Pedlars of sewing oddments, occasionally gipsy sellers came. And once a year the saltcart came, a strong, neat cart with canvas hood on strong frame, with a stout cob, or maybe a pair. The driver and scores like him, brought blocks of good salt from the salt country - originally round Droitwich, but in our time from near Bromsgrove. They came in early summer, travelling on the White Way or Salt Way over the Cotswolds (marked on the Ordnance maps), as they had done for hundreds of years. They brought supplies to farms, and you can follow the White Way over the highest, most lonely country, a thin white track running out to it from each farm. My mother bought 12 big blocks, and put them at the back of the linen cupboard. It was my job, after a hunk was cut off, to scrunch it up and roll it out to fill up the kitchen jars. Twelve blocks satisfied the year's needs for eating, cooking, and preserving.</P>

<P>There were three chapels at one time, Congregational next door to the Old George, Methodist in Clark's Hay, and Plymouth Brethren in High Street opposite Broadway Lane entrance. It is now hidden in overgrown bushes and shrubs.</P>
<P>The church has seen many alterations. From the gate to the porch there used to be a double line of yews. In the building there was no side altar below the window where Moses floats, clutching his stone tablets, no choir pews, no choir robing room at the west end. I can't say there was no choir because there was a good group of men, bass and tenor, including the blacksmith Arthur Painter. There was also a good congregation, three times a Sunday. As there was no electricity, we had hanging oil lamps and candles, and the organ was pumped. I was called in once to pump it for some extra event, and I enjoyed the conspiratorial situation among the brooms and music books and the wheezy gasps of the organ. We were lucky to have Mr. Shears as organist. He was well known round village churches all over this area.</P>

<P>The railway station and the trains were endlessly interesting. Behind the station was a wonderfully kept vegetable plot with flower trimmings, and a big pond where anyone could pick bulrushes and wayfaring tree berries, or they could fish. I remember a hard winter and people skating and sliding on it. Sensible people kept in the open, but I wanted to go in among the rushes, and so I fell through into waist-deep water and mud. My mother was rightly furious with me, and made me trot all the way back to Brook Cottage and change my clothes by the kitchen fire.</P>

<P>The train would take you to Watermoor, in Cirencester (a long walk up to the town) or to the villages on the way to Cheltenham, Foss Cross, Chedworth and others all through the hills. Or, the other way, to Cricklade, Swindon, and on to Marlborough, Savernake and Andover. Cheltenham connected with the north, Andover with Southampton. Midland &amp; South Western Junction Railway colours were mainly red brown. We had a fierce old station master, or he seemed old to me, Mr. Bowden, with two signalmen Mr. Barnfield and Mr. Cook in my recollection, our Mr. Obed Cook's father. Tickets were stamped in one of those push-up little cylinders which stood in the station -master's office's hatch. Mr. Bowden let me push it sometimes, so he was not always fierce. Obed tells me his father was 45 years at Cerney station.</P>

<P>As a naval cadet at 13 years old, my brother used to get on the train at Cerney and go down on it through to Southampton where he got the ferry for the Royal Naval College at Osborne in the Isle of Wight. Very simple. But for Cirencester the Watermoor station was awkward. For parties or evening events people hired a cab from the town.</P>

<P>The train was much used by farmers and dairymen. A small side bay and platform was made for loading horses. And on the platforms trolleys had stacks of milk churns which clanked and rattled into the guard's van. I remember on the journey to Cirencester once, a field full of mushrooms was observed, and on the return journey the train halted 'for three minutes only'  while fireman and public ran with hats, baskets and folded newspapers, and picked a bargain. After work the signalman would bring packages from the train to your house. Children and grandchildren of the staff still live in the village.</P>

<P>Over the station railway bridge, where now is lake water, was Watery Lane, now only a signpost, but to us as youngsters a most happy world, where bushes met over your head, and a parallel path led through the fields, huge single stones bridging old drainage cuts, to where Watery Lane crossed the River Churn, which had come winding from Bow Wow. You can still trace them now. There was a bathing place called The Pill, men and boys only. We used to splash along the clean gravelly shallow river, dip in the deep water at the curves, eat our slice of cake on low boughs of the huge crack willows, watch the half wild ponies in the shade, and listen to the birds and the silence.</P>

<P>Gravel slowly took over the area. I saw the last crop of hay carted and carried from the main field alongside Watery Lane by Will Maidment of Silver Street and his horse 'Dick'.</P>

<P>The Thames &amp; Severn Canal crossed the Cerney-Cirencester road outside the village, under the skew road bridge beside a lock, in a deep cutting. You can see the lock house with a piece added in front, and the lock, now a garden. I have photos of my uncles bathing in this lock. On the other side of the road the canal then crossed the fields below the present airfield to Northmoor Lane, went under another steep road bridge to swing into the edge of Cerney. A footpath crossed the fields towards Webb's Farm and the College. Bow Wow was carried over the canal by another bridge, and then the canal dropped by locks past Crane Farm to Cerney Wick, where there is a canal round-house near the road, and on to Cricklade, Inglesham near Lechlade, to join the Thames. At Cerney, where the canal went under the Cirencester Road, was the wharf, accessible to road transport. Mr. Tuck was the last lock-keeper and in charge of the wharf. Under the lock-house was a little warehouse space, and wharf gates with stone pillars gave access to it. Across the Cirencester Road was an open wharf by the canal for coal, the chief traffic left by the decline of the canal.</P>

<P>Mrs. Tuck was the village midwife and layer out of the dead. Just up the Ciren Road from the lock house was the little fever hospital, known to all as the pest house, where scarlet fever or diphtheria sufferers from all round were isolated. I believe that Mrs. Tuck helped there too, as a capable nurse and friend of all. Beside the hospital was a small brickyard, where clay was dug and bricks made. The railway end of Victoria Road in Cirencester is said to be built of Cerney bricks, and one sees them in South Cerney itself.</P>

<P>The canal was disused when I was young, but locks still held water. Below Bow Wow was our favourite, the lock by Crane Farm, fed by the Boxwell springs which produce such good watercress near Crane Farm. The towpath was wild and bushy, a sure place for flowers and birds, and a favourite Sunday walk for Cerney people. My family loved taking a picnic down there and bathing in the lock, though it was shockingly cold water and you couldn't get out of it except by climbing on to the beams across the gates. My Uncle Harry used to take John and me down there before breakfast in the summer holidays, they on bikes and me standing on the step of my uncle's bike, a most painful conveyance along the bumpy towpath.</P>

<P>The lock still holds a little water, and watercress still grows in Crane Farm fields. The village coal merchant used to live there, being near the coal wharf, and raise his own hay for the coal cart horse. His son Tom Griffith is still there. Cerney Wick got its coal from here, or straight off the barge from a nearer point on the canal.</P>

<P>In the 20s the church had a district visiting system, which operated throughout the parish of Cerney and Cerney Wick. The whole parish was divided into 'parochial districts' and a 'visitor' volunteered for each one, to deliver the parish magazine and get to know the women and families of the house. For some years my mother had Cerney Wick as her district, and regularly biked to do her job. In holidays we kids went with her, and played about with dogs and children outside. She gave a lot of time to some young mothers, and I hope some of them remember her.</P>

<P>Cerney and Cerney Wick were always ready for fun and games. Before the coming of TV or radio, entertainment was made by ourselves, and I recollect many plays, concerts, dances, sports, processions and dressing-up.</P>

<P>As one parish we celebrated the victorious end of the 1914-18 War in  fine style. In the summer of 1919 we had a decorated procession and public gathering in Garne's field in front of the College, and a supper for all the men who had served and come safe home. Talent must have been a little shy, for I figured in both these events. The procession was led by Victory and Peace - Victory being represented by Peggy Cripps (later Fenton) - on her Shetland pony Kitty, a large oval tray covered with gold paper and a Union Jack on her front, and I think a homemade spear, gold-paper tipped - and Peace who was me walking beside her and Kitty, wearing a white frock and stockings and dancing shoes, and carrying a rod twined with white ribbon and topped by a cotton wool object meant to be a dove. The procession of course consisted of similar representations of all our overseas contingents and any allies whose flags were available or could be made. Speeches and singing and jollifications made a great day.</P>

<P>The supper was in the school, and only for the returned men of the parish. But they were subjected to me clambering up the steps to the little stage, again wearing a white frock and socks, to recite a poem called, I remember all too clearly, �When the Guards came through'. The men were very polite, and I hope had had a sustaining amount of beer.</P>

<P>The village had a bowling green, in the Downings, the grass field with path through it between the church allotments and the railing of Sir Antony Royle's land by his drive gate on to Bow Wow. This was very popular, and occasioned much rolling and weeding, and bowling in summer afternoons and evenings. Cricket was played at the other end of the village, on the football part of the present playing field, though we had no official playing fields. W. G. Grace had then made Gloucestershire cricket mad. I don't remember football being really important. There was a lot of tennis, because many houses had grass courts of their own, and it was a way of getting to know people in other villages. In winter tobogganing on trays down the slopes behind Upper Mill was a great youthful excitement.</P>

<P>We had many local events and entertainments - the Mens' Benefit Clubs used to march with their banners at Whitsun, and have a gathering in a tent or one of the pubs' upper room, with beer supplied by the village brewery, as our gardener Mr. George Short told us. This was a very old gathering, and I have wondered if the former Cerney Wick Feast linked with it. The Cerney Flower Show developed a big procession of decorated floats, by village organizations, Girl Guides and others, with a band, from Silver Street up to the present playing field, where the show tent seethed with village competition. A fun fair offered galloping horses, roundabouts, swing-boats, coconut shies, and running and bicycle races for all ages. We had everything on Flower Show day. Cerney Wick had their own sports and summer holiday. We used to bike down to it, and as our children grew we all went together. Cerney Sports were fairly predictable, but Cerney Wick's were different. My husband Charles took part in a veteran's race. They lined up; at the 'on your marks', half the field started, at 'get set' the rest started, and at 'go' Charles was the only fellow left to go.</P>

<P>Concerts and plays in the school building were very popular, and of a serious standard. I remember the trial scene out of The Merchant of Venice being done, and Antonio going sick and I having to learn his part during the day. What splendid actors the village threw up! An unrehearsed moment happened when Shylock is adjurned to be merciful - whereupon the girl playing Shylock whipped off her shoe and advanced on me, stropping a long kitchen knife, and demanding:</P>
<P>'On what compulsion must I? tell me that'. Shakespeare had really got into her. Singing was good, too, group or solo, �We show them we're the bold gendarmes 'or' Red Devon by the Sea'. Or a group would sing part songs, perhaps with the vicar or music teacher joining in.</P>

<P>At Christmas, carol-singing was not confined to the church choir, for any number of groups used to tour the village for cash. Close to Christmas, most families, certainly mine, brought them into the house, made them stop giggling and sing properly, and then produced mincepies etc., with a little cash. I don't remember much notice taken of Guy Fawkes or Hallow E'en.</P>

<P>Bell-ringing was always carried on, by regular men in a practised team. Different people gave a supper for them before ringing the New Year in, and I remember these big fellows coming to our house one year, being offered slices from a huge round of beef, and then me lying in bed listening to the bells sound suddenly out of the dark.</P>
<P>Gardens in Cerney and in Wick remain basically the same, changes being mainly to save labour. But life in houses has changed from bottom to top.</P>

<P>In the 'teens' and 'twenties' our house, like everyone else's, had no electricity, gas, main water or main drainage. A few bigger houses generated their electricity. We had oil, candles, coal, wood, well-water hand-pumped up to a tank in the attic, and lavatory pans flushed with water from the tank into a cess-pit in the garden. Some houses had wells outside the door and buckets on a hook. Some had little sheds near the back door with a seat, and pans that you emptied into your garden or cess-pit. The College had these, and employed a night-soil man. He came with a cart at crack of dawn, and used great discretion.</P>

<P>Our house had a back kitchen for the rough work. There was a sink, with a duckboard to stand on, long-handled water pump, working table, big plate-rack, copper for boiling puddings, with fire-hearth under it, and door into the kitchen.</P>
<P>The kitchen held the heart of the house, the range or coal-stove, shining black, with red-barred grate, oven, broad flat top for saucepans, flat-iron, etc., and plate-racks above. Ash-pan under the fire.  Both rooms and most of the others on the ground floor were stone-paved, a great help as needing no polishing, only scrubbing once a week, and coconut matting or rugs. A big linen press for table-cloths stood in the corner of the kitchen, and a comfortable wicker chair. All the oil lamps stood on the window sill, looking on to the garden.</P>

<P>Take a morning's house-life. Up at 6.30 or 7, according to temperament, kindle the kitchen fire. Paper, kindling wood and coal had been put ready the night before. Open the barred front, rake ashes out into a bucket, lay the fire and light it. As it roared up the back flue, feed it until it was established. Put the kettle on. Take the ashes outside and fill up coal scuttle. Lay and get breakfast. Pump up water into the tank in the attic, about a quarter of an hour's job for my brother and me. Wash up. Clean knives on the knife board, (my job), put out the six or seven oil lamps and clean them, trim wicks, fill up with oil. Refill the oil-can. Clean the sitting-room grate and re-lay the fire, fill up the coal and logs. Not till that lot was done, none of which we need do today, did the jobs which we know today begin, cleaning or polishing, making beds, shopping, cooking.</P>

<P>I am not saying that many people did not have help in all this, and many other people learned good methods and standards from giving the help. There just was a great deal of work to do, and some justification for not approving of pottering about the village in the mornings. People who did not make children help in the house were much despised.</P>
<P>Village figures who stood out in my youth: the carpenter and coffinmaker, Mr. Bertie Harding, who had his coffin-making shed opposite the churchyard gate, and at one time lived next door to it. He must have been close to nearly every household in his time, a gentle, greatly-loved man and a good carpenter. The front gate of Silver Street House was designed and made by Bertie Harding. His daughter, Mrs. Daffon, lives in Station Road.</P>

<P>Our two cross-the-road neighbours were outstanding characters: Captain Will Maidment farmed the land that runs up the hill behind Silver Street. He was a wideseeing man who had tried many kinds of life, including soldiering and farming. His wife was a quiet friend to anyone in need. Long-standing friends of ours, it is good to have their daughter Nancy Dowdall and her husband and son still in the old house. Mr. Collicutt the thatcher also lived opposite to us, a character of wit and humour, and a thatcher in demand over a wide area. He used to say that every job needed the right kind of reed, so he would not buy cut reed but went to the reed area and cut his own. Biking through another village, his whistle would often hail us from the roof of a new thatching. His son has been editor of the Wilts &amp; Gloucestershire Standard for many years.</P>
<P>I daresay some people thought my father a bit of a character too, as he cut the golden privet hedge in front of Brook Cottage with his cavalry sword, using the correct cavalry strokes learnt and excelled in at Sandhurst. He said that this was better and quicker than shears. When gas and electricity arrived, he put a selection of both into Brook Cottage, as a soldier not willing to have only one line of communication.</P>

<P>I think you all know about the practice of drowning the meadows. This was to dig ditches across fields that bordered the river and let the water in, controlled by hatches - the object being to increase the fertility of the soil and raise two or more hay harvests a year or increase grazing capacity, ours being by soil and nature a grazing, milk-raising countryside. These meadows seemed to have silver ribbons stretched in order across them. Old pictures show it. The nearest in to South Cerney is now being built on, beside Lower Mill, in Bow Wow. But go up stream beyond Upper Mill and follow the bank through a field, and you can see the old channels, dry now that the hatches have fallen in, but still discernible, with hugh bridging stones fallen as the soil dried. David Iles, another from Silver Street, used to walk the river line in the parish of Cerney and Cerney Wick adjusting the hatches.</P>

<P>Many sights of old Cerney are saved for us by the watercolours of Miss Dolly Hall, a gentle, friendly soul who lived in No. 5 the College, and carried her little easel, stool and precious paints wherever the spirit of her eye led her - cottage groups, back doors, barn steps, fields, streams, stones or hedges. All Cerney loved her, and treasured her paintings. The South Cerney Trust once organized an exhibition, and the impact of them all together astonished us.</P>

<P>There is so much to remember, but I shall stop now, hoping that I have called up a few old memories.</P>
