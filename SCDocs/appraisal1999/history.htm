<h2 style="margin-left: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-top: 18.0pt; margin-bottom: 6.0pt">Our Charter</h2>

<p>In 999 King Aethelred II issued two charters rehearsing
events that had occurred some fifteen years earlier and, no doubt the reason
for the charters, clarifying details.</p>

<p>In 983 Ealdorman Aelfhere of Mercia died. He had, for some
years, been probably the most important adviser to a succession of Kings and he
was a close ally of Aelfthryth, Queen Mother of King Aethelred. There is
evidence, from charters and wills, that to the, no doubt extensive lands
already held by the princes of Mercia the grateful monarchs had added more.</p>

<p>On his death he was succeeded by his brother-in-law, Aelfric
Cild, and almost at once problems arose.</p>

<p>At a local level, a &quot;noble matron&quot; Eadflaed, who
was almost certainly the widow of Aelfhere, complained to the King that Aelfric
had &quot;violently&quot; seized several of her lands including Cerney. (It
would have been in accordance with Saxon practice for a nobleman like Aelfhere
to have sought royal approval when planning the disposal of his estates after
his death and to have appointed the King as protector of the will.)</p>

<p>At a national level, it was claimed that Aelfric had
instigated revolt and turned the people of his lands against the King.</p>

<p>At a Royal Council, held at Cirencester, in 985, the
assembled nobles passed judgement on the affair. Aelfric was banished for
treason and the disputed lands were returned to Eadflaed, on condition that at
her death they would return to the King and he promised to pass them on to the
monastery of St Mary's, Abingdon. This did in fact happen and it was the almost
contemporary chroniclers at the monastery who reported the story. (They also
lamented the fact that within a few years Archbishop Stigand duped the Abbot
into parting with the parish, a story confirmed by an inserted entry in
Domesday Book.)<</p>

<p>For some reason, perhaps the death of Eadflaed, in 999 two
charters were issued describing the events outlined above, discussing the
perfidy of Aelfric Cild, and, most importantly for us describing in detail the
boundaries of the &quot;fertile&quot; lands and of that &quot;little
settlement&quot; of Cerney. Few parishes can have been established by such a
distinguished cast: King Aethelred II, the Queen Mother Aelfthryth, the King's
son Athelstan, and one version of the charter adds another son Eadred, the
Archbishops of both York and Canterbury, ten bishops, four Ealdormen, six
Abbots, assorted royal kinsmen and ministers.</p>

<p>Remarkably the boundaries of the parish of Cerney, which
incorporates both South Cerney and Cerney Wick, have remained unchanged to the
present day.</p>

the parish boundaries were defined. They, and the church that followed soon

<p class=MsoBodyText2>Indeed for a time, from 950 - 1150, the parish was of
great importance because of its strategic location at the southern tip of the
Cotswolds and also because of the richness of the soil and the lush meadows.
Great lords sought to control the parish: Ealdormen of Mercia, Archbishop
Stigand and successive Earls of Hereford. The destruction of Cerney castle in
1139, the triumph of King Stephen, and the succession of Henry II, effectively
ended the political role of the parish.</p>

between the Priory of Lanthony Secunda at Gloucester, the Abbey of St.Augustine
at Bristol and the St. Amand family. Despite the division the village grew and
flourished. The records show that its population increased, agriculture
flourished and the presence of a fulling mill, weavers, textile workers and
dyers suggests a significant woollen and cloth industry in the 14th century.
After the dissolution of the monasteries and with the fading of the St. Amand
line, new owners broke up the estates and sold off much of the land.<o:p/></span></p>

rash of house building in the 16th and 17th centuries: Upper Up, Silver Street
Station Road and the High Street, Church and School Lanes and much of Cerney
Wick are all from this time. The economic base for this was undoubtedly agriculture
and the richness of the meadows and water meadows were a source of widespread
comment. The coming of the canal and its wharves and, almost a century later in
1884, of the railway only served to encourage the growth of the village,
increasingly a source of labour as well as goods and produce for the
surrounding area. The census returns of the nineteenth century reveal a village
of around a thousand people at first working in the parish, but later many
travelling to Cirencester and Swindon.</p>

</v:shape><![endif]-->The last century
has seen dramatic change. The railway has gone, gravel extraction has come and
the canal, closed in the 1920's, is due for a new lease of life. The parish is
now separated by man-made lakes, the Water Park, home to a growing leisure
industry. New housing has proliferated and surrounds the historic centre of the
village. The airfield was established in 1936 and served as an important
training base for RAF personnel up to about 1970 when it was transferred to the
Army as the Duke of Gloucester Barracks. An industrial estate along Broadway
Lane has expanded rapidly and the village population has doubled in the past
twenty years to over 3000.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>Now 1000 years after our Charter, 900 years after
Domesday and three times larger than the Victorian village we have made another
attempt to take stock of where and what we are - and where we want to go and
what we want for our successors in this large, vital and historically important
community. Domesday was a result of questions asked of local people. Our
appraisal follows the precedent. Domesday reported on what had been and what
was. Our appraisal asks what is and what might be.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='text-align:justify'>In its own way the
appraisal is every bit as remarkable as the earlier enquiries. That it was
accomplished in such a large community is a great tribute to the hard work of a
handful of dedicated individuals and to the community spirit and participation
of the whole parish. To suggest the report can guide us through the next 1000
years might be optimistic, but it surely provides a beacon to guide us into the
next millennium.</p>
