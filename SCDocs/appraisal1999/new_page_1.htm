<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">We all shared concerns regarding the needs and development of our Parish and felt, hopefully, that our fellow villagers shared similar thoughts.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Following initial guidance from Barbara Bridges of the Gloucestershire Rural Community Council, we eventually produced our Village Questionnaire after prolonged discussions, many meetings and numerous drafts. The questions were derived, with much adaptation, from the Village Appraisal Computer 
Programme obtained from Cheltenham and Gloucester College of Higher Education. The continuous aim was to gauge the views, concerns and interests of the village. Our hopes for a good response were realised with a return of 76 per cent. This was very encouraging!</font></P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></B><font size="3">Our very grateful thanks go to all those who completed this daunting task, and for their patience and commitment. It showed above all that we care, and although sceptics may belittle statistics, they are none the less essential support for any claim or proposal.</font></P> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Our thanks now go to an intrepid and persistent group of seventy volunteers who delivered and collected the Questionnaires during the late summer and early autumn of 1997. Hot on their heels came seven more volunteers who put the returned data on computer - this task alone required some 300 hours of work.</font></P> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Lastly, our thanks go to the sponsors for our lottery, which ran with the questionnaire. Since only the third prize was claimed, the remaining prize money has been used to defray some of the costs of printing this report.</font></P> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img border="0" src="Aerial2.jpg" width="443" height="354"></P> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">We are hopeful that the Report will be a 
valuable reference for the thoughts and ideas of South Cerney and Cerney Wickï¿½s parishioners at the close of our village's Millennium; the bonus will be any improvements resulting from its contents.</font></P> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Two issues of concern have arisen since our efforts, namely the noise pollution following the opening of the Cirencester by-pass and the possible development on the Robert Franklin Way playing fields and at Jubilee Gardens. We sincerely hope these problems are resolved satisfactorily.</font></P><ul>
