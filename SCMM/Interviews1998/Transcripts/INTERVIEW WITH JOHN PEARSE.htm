<B><U><P>INTERVIEW WITH JOHN PEARSE</P>

</B></U><FONT SIZE=2><P>Tape 14</P>
<B>
<P>Q 01.14&#9;</B>What’s your official title as far as the actual bell ringing is concerned?</P>
<B><P>A 01.22&#9;</B>I’m called Tower Captain, I suppose.</P>

<B><P>Q 01.26&#9;</B>Can you describe the peal?</P>
<B><P>A 01.29&#9;</B>We’ve got 6 bells and the heaviest is about 10 ½ hundredweight, they obviously go down the scales, the normal thing.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 01.48</B>&#9;Is there anything unique to do with the set up?</P>
<B><P>A 01.55</B>&#9;There isn’t really</P>

<B><P>Q02.04</B>&#9;You recently had them refurbished, where was that done?</P>
<B><P>A 02.07</B>&#9;It was done by Whites and Appleton, they took the bells away and then they went to White Chapel in London to be tuned. We helped get them out of the tower with tackle and that was three years ago now. They are much better for tuning, they have got new bearings, two new wheels, because 2 of the wheels fell apart when we dismantled them, so we had to have 2 new wheels, new bearings, new clappers, the same old bells of course, except they’re tuned.</P>

<B><P>Q 02.53</B>&#9;Describe to me from the largest down, what they are?</P>
<B><P>A 02.58</B>&#9;In weight do you mean or note?  I don’t know.  They’re different ages I think.</P>

<B><P>Q 03.57</B>&#9;How many bell ringers do you have?</P>
<B><P>A 04.01</B>&#9;The number of bell ringers is always a bit difficult to say exactly, I suppose 9 regular who come almost very week when they are available and one or two others that occasionally come. Like Raymond, who comes on Ascension Day usually.</P>

<B><P>Q 04.26</B>&#9;When do you rehearse?</P>
<B><P>A 04.30</B>&#9;We practice on a Thursday evening at 7.30pm.  We’ve got some of the bell ringers don’t live in the village now, Ruth’s moved to Somerford Keynes, Calvin lives in Cricklade and Barbara and Mary live in Cirencester, I think we’ve got 5 in the village.</P>

<B><P>Q 05.07</B>&#9;Do you know anything about the history of the bells?</P>
<B><P>A 05.18</B>&#9;No I’m not very well up on this really.</P>

<B><P>Q 05.22</B>&#9;What is the most complicated peal?</P>
<B><P>A 05.28</B>&#9;I’m not keen on peals, because that takes 3 hours, quarter peels we ring quite regularly.  I think the most complicated method probably is London Surprise minor, we can also ring Cambridge Surprise, which is a bit easier and loads of other minor and double methods, sort of plain methods, but London is the most complicated, we’ve never rung a quarter peal, we can ring a touch if we’re oh form.</P>

<B><P>Q 06.02</B>&#9;I believe visiting teams …….(?) – inaudible</P>
<B><P>A 06.14</B>&#9;Yes a number of peals have been rung on the bells, but not for 10 or 15 years.  There have been between 10 and 15 peels I think, all the time they have been in the tower.  We get visitors come round on outings, but they ring for about ¾ hour.</P>

<B><P>Q06.56</B>&#9;Tell us what a peal is?</P>
<B><P>A 07.05</B>&#9;A peel consists of 5,040 changes, which is the maximum number of changes you can ring on 7 bells.  When we ring methods, we always start from rounds, ring every different change you can get, then come back to rounds. On doubles every change, because the maximum is 120 on 5 and the maximum on 6 in 720, so that’s quite a short touch really.</P>

<B><P>Q 07.46</B>&#9;Are you planning any special peals next year for the millennium?</P>
<B><P>A 07.49</B>&#9;I’m sure we’ll be planning something for the millennium, but I don’t know quite what yet, I was unable to go to the meeting because that was our practice night, but I’m sure we will be doing something.</P>

<B><P>Q 08.02</B>&#9;What would you like to do that’s special?</P>
<B><P>A 08.06</B>&#9;I don’t know really, cause the really special thing is a peal, but that takes 3 hours, and that’s an awful long time, standing still pulling the rope for 3 hours, so I don’t know, there will probably be several quarter peels, I should think, that’s the most likely.  ¾ of an hour is just a nice time.</P>

<B><P>Q 08.30</B>&#9;What time of day would you like to do it, does it matter?</P>
<B><P>A 08.35</B>&#9;It doesn’t matter too much, perhaps and evening or Sunday or Saturday afternoon perhaps.</P>

<B><P>Q 08.47</B>&#9;On an average week how much bell ringing gets involved with services?</P>
<B><P>A 08.58</B>&#9;In a normal week, we practice on a Thursday 7.30 – 9.00.  On Sunday we ring usually for the Evensong which is 5.16 – 6.00, and occasionally there is a wedding which we ring for probably about 20 – 30 minutes after the wedding.  Then occasionally we get visitors for about an hour.  What happens then is we organise and the open tower and let them ring whatever they want for about an hour then they go away to another tower, and do the same sort of thing.</P>

<B><P>Q 09.42</B>&#9;I would connect bell ringing with also beer drinking, am I right?</P>
<B><P>A 09.48</B>&#9;Quite often bell ringers go to the pub after, but it’s not a local thing here, probably because I’m not keen on going to the pub and drinking a lot.  Not that I dislike pubs because we go in them on holiday, but we just like to get back and have a coffee.</P>

<LI>To teach a bell ringer is not easy, but it’s difficult to explain without having the bell there, but there is a handstroke and a backstroke, the rope has got a fluffy bit which is about 2 feet long about 6 feet up the rope, and you’ve got hand circle which is the sally, and you have the tail end in your hand, so you pull off the sally and the bell in the tower does a complete circle and the rope goes up and you pull it back down again and catch it, that is the backstroke.  To teach somebody, I always start with the backstroke. So they just have hold of the rope at the end of it, and I do the sally and just sort of steady the rope to make sure they are not pulling too hard or hard enough or else the bell, instead of doing a full circle, if they are not pulling hard enough it will tend to go less and less then come down and the rope starts flapping about.  So we usually start at backstroke on their own and then you swap over and then they do the handstroke on their own, then we put it together with me steadying at both end, and this takes about 2 or 3 weeks of handstroke, then we gradually bring them in with the band of the ringers, then start on rounds which is ringing down the scale 1 to 6, then when they’re competent at that we start them on call changes which is we actually call a number out, so if you imagine the bells numbered 1,2,3,4,5,6, supposing we said 2 to follow 3, the 2 would then go over the 3, and the 3 would jump down a place, that’s call changes.  Then gradually go into learning methods, which they start from the treble, or it can be tenor, if it’s an adult, possibly a tenor, because the tenor tends on doubles, just follows on behind.  If it’s a youngster probably a treble, which is the number 1 bell, which is what we call the treble, and number 6 is what we call the tenor.  And the treble on most simple methods moves one place at a time up through the bells until it gets to fifth place, and does another round in fifth and works one place back down until it gets back down to the ….(?) again, and when they can do that well, we then start going into methods which is very similar but moving up one place at a time, but it probably then has a ….(?) which is going over a bell and coming back down and on and up again, but once they get the first method it becomes easier and you can explain where the …(?) come for other methods.</LI></OL>

<P>Q 13.37&#9;What are the most important qualities for bell ringing?</P>
<P>A 13.42&#9;That’s difficult to say.  You want a lot of things really.  You need to be co-ordinated I think.  You need a funny sort of mind to get hold of these methods. I think most people can learn, you’d have to be pretty uncoordinated not to be able to learn.  Some people take longer than others.  I think generally youngsters tend to pick it up much quicker.  The problem generally then is that they have so many other things to do, so many other societies and things to belong to they don’t tend to stick at it for long.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 14.40&#9;Mathematical formulae?</P>
<P>A 14.42&#9;Perhaps maths would help, yes.  There are lots of other facets of bell ringing. Some people are keen on the history of the bells, because some bells are very old.  They’ve got one in Kemble which is 1450 I think, so that’s very old.  Some people just like going round looking at bells and making notes of the designs.  Most bells have got the dates on them, unless they are very, very old, five or six hundred years old, but they didn’t put dates on around that time.  Later years then they’ve all got dates on and very often the vicar’s name, the churchwarden’s name and designs and all sorts of things round the waist of the bell.</P>

<P>Q 15.45&#9;Have you got any bells cast by the Ruddles?</P>
<P>A 15.49&#9;Yes, I think they are all cast by Ruddles.  There are several Ruddles, I’m not sure which our are cast by. </P>

<P>Q 16.11&#9;Inaudible question</P>
<P>A 16.17&#9;As well as the 6 bells which we ring full circle there is the ting tang which is used usually five minutes before the service.  I think that was cast in 1662, and that’s definitely the oldest one in the tower.</P>

<P>Q 16.57&#9;Have there been any complaints?</P>
<P>A 16.59&#9;We’re very lucky in South Cerney I don’t remember ever having a complaint about the bells, we have had one or two when we haven’t rung.  People have wondered why w are not ringing, probably holidays and that sort of thing.  I don’t remember having a complaint about the noise of anybody who doesn’t like them.  Many churches do have complaints, but we do try restrict the ringing quite a bit, we don’t ring excessively, which I think helps.  Some churches are ringing peals quite often, 3 hours at a stretch is a bit much I think.</P>

<P>Q 17.47&#9;Were there any special peals for the Coronation?</P>
<P>A 17.59&#9;I don’t know.</P>

<P>Q 18.00&#9;Royal weddings or the Jubilee?</P>
<P>A 18.14&#9; I wasn’t here, I don’t know.</P>

<P>Q 18.27&#9;Were you yourself born in South Cerney?</P>
<P>A 18.29&#9;No, I was born in Cirencester in Silver Street.</P>

<P>Q 18.35&#9;Where did you go to school?</P>
<P>A 18.38&#9;I went to Lewis Lane Junior School, the then Lewis Lane Infant School, then they decided to re-organise how the town was split up between the schools, so I then changed to Powells, school, and then the Grammar School.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 18.57&#9;Where did you do your training?</P>
<P>A 19.00&#9;Bell ringing? I learned to ring at Chedworth.  Elizabeth was already a bell ringer at Chedworth when we met and I started going there, I used to sit and watch and listen and eventually got dragged in to start learning. So Elizabeth, my wife, has been ringing a long time, much longer than I have, I was a latecomer I suppose.  </P>

<P>Q 19.28&#9;Do you have any children?</P>
<P>A 19.30&#9;No we don’t have any children, by choice</P>

<P>Q 19.44&#9;When did you get married?</P>
<P>A 19.45&#9;We were married in 1968, by Canon Arthur Dodds, who was also a bell ringer. We learned at Chedworth in quite difficult circumstances, because there were about 7 of us but only 1 person could ring, we could all handle a bell, but we only had one person who could ring a method, so we started off by learning 120 numbers, and we had to ring the same 120 ….(?) doubles, otherwise if we rang anything else, we didn’t know what to do, and eventually we picked up the methods, it was difficult for us, it is much easier if you’ve got a good band around you, then you can just stand in as one newcomer, but if you are all learning it is very difficult.</P>
