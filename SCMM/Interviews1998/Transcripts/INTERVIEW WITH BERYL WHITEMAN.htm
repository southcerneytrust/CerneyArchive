<B><U>
</U><P>Q 06.02&#9;&#9;</B>Tell me your name, and where were you born?</P>




<B><P>A 06.07&#9;</B>Beryl Whiteman, I was born at Cerney Wick, and we later came to live in South Cerney.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 06.14&#9;</B>Did you go to Ann Edward’s School?</P>
<B><P>A 06.18&#9;</B>Yes, the old school in School Lane.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 06.26&#9;</B>What was it like going to school there, can you tell me what a day’s classes were like?</P>
<B><P>A 06.32&#9;</B>I can remember when I first started, I was in the infant’s, the teacher was Miss Tompkins, she was quite strict, she always had a pointer, that she pointed things out and it came in useful for knocking knuckles too.  Then I went into the second class, which was Miss Bayes, she was a teacher who came from Kemble and she used to come on her motorbike, and then later on was Miss Dunn, she also came from Kemble.  The next class was what they called the top class and that’s where you were until you left.</P>
<B>




<P>Q 07.34&#9; &#9;</B>What lessons did you start the day with?</P>




<B><P>A 07.37</B>&#9;We always had prayers.  We always started with that, then followed on with the usual.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 07.50</B>&#9;Where did you go when you left school?</P>
<B><P>A 07.52</B>&#9;I went to work at the vicarage for Mr and Mrs Kennon, and then later on they had, when war came they had a couple of evacuees.  After I left there, I worked at the CWS Creamery<I> </I>at Latton.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 08.25</B>&#9;How long where you there?</P>
<B><P>A</B> <B>08.27</B>&#9;The creamery, Oh I should think I was there about five years.</P>

</FONT><B><P>Q 08.40&#9;</B>And what did you do there?</P>




<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>A 08.41&#9;&#9;</B>We canned the evaporated milk that they sell in shops.</P>

</FONT><B><P>Q 09.01</B>&#9;How old were you when you went there?</P>
<B><P>A 09.03&#9;</B>I suppose I was about 26 or something like that.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<B><P>Q 09.13&#9;&#9;</B>How did you meet your husband?</P>




<B><P>A 09.15&#9;</B>Probably at a dance, I think that’s where everybody met them after the war wasn’t it, although during the war of course they had dances in the village, but he was in the Army so for 6 years he was in the Royal Engineers, he served abroad, North Africa and Italy, then he was de-mobbed and I suppose I met his a couple of years after that.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 09.57&#9;</B>I gather the music was very good at the dances?</P>
<B><P>A 09.59&#9;</B>Oh yes, it was very good.  They used to have some quite good bands, especially during the wartime there was some quite good musicians, that used to come down from the Camp and they had their little band and they used to play at the village dances, that cost us a shilling.   On Friday nights we used to go there, great fun.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 10.39</B>&#9;Can you remember any of the air raids during the war?</P>
<B><P>A 10.43&#9;</B>There were one or two round here, there was a bomb at Ashton Keynes I believe, and one at Cerney Wick, I remember that, the plane going round one Monday morning, going quite low, I was at the bedroom window.  What would it be incendiary bombs, wouldn’t it, they just dropped them as they unloaded them as they went round I believe.  Somebody told me that, whether it’s right or not I don’t know.</P>
<B>




<P>Q 11.27&#9;</B>&#9;Do you think they were aiming for the Midlands?</P>
<B><P>A 11.36&#9;</B>&#9;I don’t know if they would be if they were here would they?</P>




<P>They had the Dakotas the gliders and all didn’t they, and round this area there were lots of aerodromes.</P>





<B><P>Q 12.05&#9;</B>&#9;Was there a big build up before D-Day?</P>
<B><P>A 12.07&#9;&#9;</B>Yes, then suddenly off they went you heard all these planes go.</P>

<B><P>Q 12.22</B>&#9;&#9;No time to wish them goodbye?</P>
<B><P>A 12.23</B>&#9;&#9;No they were gone.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 12.33&#9;</B>&#9;When did you start with the Guides?</P>




<B><P>A 12.35&#9;</B>I was a Brownie first, I joined at 8, I wasn’t at Brownies very long, because the brown owl at the time went away and then there was a lapse of a few years.  And then I joined Guides and the Captain was Miss Peggy Cripps, I was in the wren patrol I believe, we had two patrols at the time, and I think I was put in the wren patrol to start, and I went through Guides and then when the war came, Mrs Fenton went, and Miss Harris from the Limes took over, but she wasn’t doing it very long because she was a VAD and she went off, so we were more or less left on our own and we soldiered on and kept going.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 14.09</B>&#9;Were you involved with any campaigns of any kind?</P>
<B><P>A 14.12&#9;</B>We did various things through Guides for raising money, ….(?) for victory, but there were others besides, several others and they collected jam jars for the WI for jam making.</P>
</FONT><B>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>Q 14.48&#9;</B>Do you remember any particular shortages in materials?</P>
<B><P>A 14.59</B>&#9;What do you mean food?   I did have a ration book, but I let someone else have it because they were doing a project for the Cubs, and they wanted something to give a talk, so I gave the ration book away.  I know if you lived in a town and you saw a queue, you fell in behind, you didn’t realise what you were queuing for until you got nearly to the end of the queue.</P>





<B><P>Q 15.34&#9;&#9;</B>What about your uniforms?</P>




<B><P>A 15.37&#9;</B>We always had, it was a policy that they provided your uniforms and you lent them for as long as you were a guide, and then of course you handed it back when you finished with it.  Later on some people bought their own.  Uniforms changed, the ones we had when I joined were far out of date then.  Then they went to a blouse and skirt, which everyone thought was wonderful to have this nice blue blouse and skirt instead of the old dress and was baggy.</P>
<B>




<P>Q 16.34&#9;</B>&#9;Describe the hat when you joined.</P>




<B><P>A 16.37&#9;</B>It was felt, navy blue felt, it had a quite a wide brim which was inclined to be floppy, and when we went on parade on Armistice Day or if we went to any district or division rally or something like that you always had to get your guide hat out with a damp cloth and a very hot iron and steam it, then the brim came stiff again.  Then they changed into berets, which was much easier.</P>

<B><P>Q 17.35&#9;</B>Do you remember any summer camps, both during the war and after?</P>
<B><P>A 17.41&#9;</B>No they didn’t camp during he war, after the war they gradually started again.  I think the first one I went to and that was helping the QN was at Saundersfoot, near Tenby and that really was a wet one.  Then there was Fox Leaze.  That was Guide Headquarters, that was always very nice at Fox Leaze.  Lovely surroundings, you were always under canvas, you never camped inside at that time, whatever the weather, you were outside.  Nevertheless everybody seemed to enjoy it, get thoroughly wet.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 18.55</B>&#9;Were people fairly healthy, the girls and things?</P>
<B><P>A 18.58</B>&#9;Yes.  I think you had to be to be a camper.  You rarely heard of people getting cold through going camping.  I think that was instilled, particularly by Miss Cripps that you took care, you always had your groundsheets and everything was kept dry so really you didn’t get wet.  You always put your wet weather stuff on if it was raining, there was any it’s not raining much I won’t go out, you just had to put it on, which was a good thing really.</P>

<B><P>Q 19.49</B>&#9;Did you do any first aid work, or first aid in hospitals?</P>
<B><P>A 19.55&#9;</B>No we didn’t do it in hospitals, but in the village I think Mrs Kennon was there, she did the first aid and she used to do classes that you all turned up for just in case it was needed.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 20.25</B>&#9;Talk about the Berries and what did you do there?</P>
<B><P>A 20.30&#9;</B>That was a great place for hikes and farmers were very good they let you go.  We used to go off on our hikes, have a haversack, not the haversacks that you have today, but made of material, they used to take what they were going to cook, they picked a nice spot, somewhere preferably where there was some water quite near, and your cut the turf rolled in back and put stones round, so you didn’t damage any of the grass, then they collected the wood and lit the fires and used to cook various things, at first they probably baked potatoes and they always made a damper.  A damper was made of flour and water which you put on the end of a nice ask stick, which you peel then put it to cook and if it was cooked properly it would come off the stick, but if it stuck you knew it was all soggy inside, and after that you filled it with jam and ate it.  Sometimes it was burnt offerings, but the jam covered a multitude of sins.  We used to go to other places, down by the canal, we always went there, we always went on the tracks and scavenge hunt, but quite a lot of our time was spent in the gardens of the Manor, I think we spent nearly as much time in the garden as they probably did.  The meetings in the summer we were nearly always in there if we didn’t go out for a hike.  Each patrol had their own corners. We had outdoor meetings, just the same more or less as if you were inside, but it was nicer out, and you could play different games when you were out on the grass than if you were in the hut, then later on we went to the stables at Atkyns Manor, and we used to sit round on logs.  They had their corners, by that time they had got to four patrols, and instead of just being Wren and Oak, it was Wren, Oak, Lily and Orchid, and used to do exactly the same things.  Then later on we moved out, when Mrs Fenton moved into Little Atkyns, we moved into the stables.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 24.44</B>&#9;Do you remember shopping as a girl at places like Dorlings?</P>
<B><P>A 24.47&#9;</B>I think everybody remembers shopping at Dorlings, especially the children, during the war he had a favourite thing he used to sell to the children.  He had a bottle of Tizer and he used to fill the ice cube trays with the Tizer and charge them a penny each, and I think somebody told me the bottle only cost 7½d in those days, so he made quite a profit on it, and when he hadn’t got any Tizer, he used to do just the ice cubes, and I think they cost a ½d, and they didn’t realise they were buying water. I was only told that the other day, they could tell quite a lot of tales I think about Mr Dorling.  I think somebody told me about a paper round they did, and for an extra bonus he gave him a sweet, nothing very great, but it was for doing the papers exceptionally well while someone else was on holiday.  There was another little shop, Morgans in the High Street, that was a funny little shop, she sold everything, and it was also a bakery, they used to do bread and you could always take the mixture for your dough cake and you could take it up to the bakery and he would cook it.  I expect you had to pay, but very good they were too.  The other shop where you got good value for money was Miss Lane’s, Miss (?) I think it was to start with, and you always got good value there, that was a little sweet shop, then there was Luker’s on the other side of the road, he sold nearly everything, that’s where the Post Office is now, I can’t remember the other shops, apart from the butcher, that was Mr Ewer, he had a daughter, I think her name was Nelly, she used to do a lot of walking, she used to walk into town, somebody stopped and asked he if she’d like a lift one day and she said no thank you, I’m in a hurry, so I don’t know if she was a fast walker or if it was a slow driver, I’m not sure.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 28.26</B>&#9;When you said Morgans sold all sorts of things, what?</P>
<B><P>A 28.30</B>&#9;Grocery, you could get any sort of grocery there.</P>

<B><P>Q 28.47</B>&#9;Did you go to Miss Hall’s sewing classes?</P>
<B><P>A 28.50&#9;</B>Yes I did.<B>  </B>I think everybody went there, didn’t they.  We used to go on Tuesday evenings and we used to do little things there, but mostly cutting up stuffing for cushions and things like that.  The scissors really they were really a bit on the blunt side and you ended up with blisters more often than not, but we did go there and we did little bits of sewing, but mostly it was cutting up to stuff pillows and cushions.  She was also the Sunday school teacher, we were in Miss Hall’s class at Sunday school and we must have met in the Church I should think at that time, most Sunday schools did.  In the afternoon on Sundays we went, and that’s about all I know.   And we always worked at Miss Hall’s sewing class it was to do things for the SPCG; I may have the initials wrong.   She had a sale in the summer and</FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>that was usually on the vicarage lawn, and the money raised went to the fund.</P>
<B>




<P>Q 30.53&#9;&#9;</B>Did you enjoy these gatherings?</P>




<B><P>A 30.58&#9;</B>I think we did, but there wasn’t a lot to do in those days, so I think we were glad to go anywhere, but apart from that I think we did on the whole, we quite enjoyed it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 31.13&#9;</B>How did young people, sort of the younger ones, did they enjoy playing in the fields, that sort of thing, when you were young?</P>
<B><P>A 31.23&#9;</B>Playing games.  In the<B> </B>summer in those days, summer holidays, you used to take some sandwiches and a bottle of drink and you’d be gone all day. One of the favourite was down Wilmer Lane and there was a river and you could spend your day down there, paddling and eating whatever you’d taken and then walk back home again.  Of course you had to walk everywhere in those days you see.  Another favorite place was along by the river where the houses are now, Meadow Way and River Way and following up along there.  That was a favourite place for Guides as well when we went hiking as was Wilmer Lane as well.  We played the usual games you know that they did, but nowadays you can’t go out like we used to.  Going for long walks, that was another thing, you could go and pick flowers, which of course you can’t do now, you’re not allowed to pick most of the flowers that we did.  I remember with the Guides we used to go in that big field opposite Mr Tom Sandall’s and we used to pick cowslips which were sent to a children’s hospital in London.</P>
<B>




<P>Q 33.19&#9;</B>&#9;Did they ever write back and say thank you?</P>




<B><P>A 33.21&#9;</B>Oh yes, I think in the log books you will probably find a letter from some of them, those log books really are interesting, they can tell you more than I can ever remember.  They’re a very good record, because they are right from the start when Guides started, right up to, I expect they’re still being done now.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 33.47&#9;</B>You’ve got your own log book there, a little souvenir of your life?</P>
<B><P>A 33.52&#9;</B>Yes, this was given to me when I retired, and it was given from the District, from the Guides of course, but it’s mostly ex-Guides and people I’ve camped with, and there’s one from the District Commissioner, there’s a letter from her in here, but yes it’s a nice record, I was very pleased with it.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 34.35</B>&#9;Do you think that the village has grown a bit too much?</P>
<B><P>A 34.38</B>&#9;It has grown rather a lot I think, for a village. I can remember when I used to go up the village and you knew everybody you met, now if you go up you’ll be lucky if you see one person you know, the real people who you know.  And of course where as Guides we used to be able to go, another favourite place where we used to spend a lot of summer evenings, that was the Meadows, that was owned by Mr Hapgood, and it’s where Meadow Way and River Way, the houses are. And another place we went, you go down Bow Wow and you go across the little wooden bridge and take the footpath to your left and we used to go there and we used to go in the fields down there, but it’s all houses now so you can’t.  All the places you used to go as Guides, that were near, where you could go and spend the evening perhaps on cooking your supper or playing, you can’t do that, it’s all gone.  I suppose people have got to live somewhere, and this is what they call progress, I suppose</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 36.32&#9;</B>Do you think people were more content then or now?</P>
<B><P>A 36.40&#9;</B>Well really, I think<B> </B>people were more content then, you didn’t expect so much, I think you were grateful for what you had.  Nowadays it seems that you’ve never seem to have enough do you, if you have something, you want something else.  Whereas things were different in our time, if you’d have wanted it you couldn’t have got it, so I think this is just the difference.</P>
<B>
</B><P>Q 37.18&#9;Did people have to save pennies up rather, when you were young?</P>
<P>A 37.22&#9;Oh yes, I mean pennies, you had to.  The thing was if you didn’t have the money you couldn’t buy it, because there was no credit or things like that, so as they used to say if you haven’t got the money in your pocket you can’t have it.</P>

<P>Q 37.53&#9;Do you remember what wages your father brought back or your grandfather?</P>
<P>A 37.58&#9;My grandfather, that would be about, well not a lot I shouldn’t have thought, because a farm labourer at the beginning of the war, or was it just after was only earning 30 shillings a week and that was with a family, so the wages were, a lot of wages would only have been about a couple of pounds a week, but then the things were cheaper.  I mean nowadays the wages are so high aren’t they so things are much more expensive.  Another thing you didn’t have washing machines, you didn’t have television, you didn’t have radio to start with.  If you went anywhere, I can remember when the bus first came, I think it was the Gloucester bus, I think it was 4d to go into Cirencester when it started, and now it’s well over a pound to go into Cirencester.  The Gloucester bus used to come, it was quite a good service really, and it was used in those days because people didn’t have cars.  It was nothing to walk to Cirencester. I’ve done it times in my youth of course, you had to or cycle.  To go to the dances, we used to go to the Corn Hall and places like that and surrounding villages, but you had to cycle if you wanted to get there.  There was no taxis because people didn’t have the cars, so that if you wanted to go, you worked out a way to get there.  It was walk or cycle.  Still we survived.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><P>Q 40.44&#9;</B>Do you remember your first wage at the CWS?</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>A  40.57&#9;</B>I<B> </B>think that was in the region of about £2.50, but mind that could have been overtime, because in the summer you had to work probably on a Sunday as well as in the evenings, because as more milk came in it had to be canned, so I think that would be about it, and that was a fairly good wage.  You biked there and back for it too, winter and summer.  I can even remember once when snow was on the ground, when several girls from the village were working there, we walked down in the snow, we went down Wilmer Lane, but what we didn’t realise was where the ditches were you went down, so when you walked suddenly you went down and there was nothing, where the ditch was.  We came out quite near the factory, but it was quite interesting, it was a good life while it lasted.</P>
<B><P>&#9;</B>I think I must have been lucky, we had a very good start because Miss Cripps, she had discipline but we had fun, and I can always remember something she said, a disciplined child is a happy child, and I think that’s right. Because we knew when we were expected to do things properly and when we could let go and have some fun, and I think that followed through.  I think I must have been lucky with the ones I’ve had, I’ve had some good girls, really good ones but there were beginning to change just a little bit just before I left, because of course there was all the television, the various programmes and you see they were just beginning to get a little bit they wanted to watch the TV, on the whole they were good and we had a very good attendance, as you can see from the log books, we had quite a good number right up to the end.  When we had fundraising things, in the summer we always had the summer sale, but everybody was expected to do their little bit, collect the jumble that sort of thing and they did and that all stems from the way we started, you’ve got to help yourself a bit you can’t expect to raise money and expect somebody else to do it for you, you must show a little bit of interest, and I always felt that they did do their bit, some more than others, but they’re not all the same are they?  Everybody’s probably got something to give, some more than others.</P>

<B><P>Q 45.30</B>&#9;Mr and Mrs Peyman, they must have been good teachers generally in the school.</P>
<B><P>A 45.39&#9;</B>That was after me, Mr Rigall(?) was my headmaster</P>
<B>
<P>Q 45.50&#9;</B>Do you remember the master and mistress’s cottage behind?</P>
<B><P>A 45.54&#9;</B>Yes, Mr &amp; Mrs R and their daughter Valerie, used to live there, in the old school house.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 46.03</B>&#9;What was it like?</P>
<B><P>A 46.05</B>&#9;What the school house? Quite a big house, in fact I think they lived one side and I don’t know about the other part, whether they had it for something to do with the school, probably books or storage or something like that, but it really was quite a nice sized house.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 46.39</B>&#9;Do you remember any other details about it?</P>
<B><P>A 46.42&#9;</B>About the house? It probably had a grey slate roof, and it was quite a long house with a door in the middle. I can see that house now, really, it must have been pulled own I suppose.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>




<P>Q 47.24</B>&#9;&#9;Yes, we’ve got the details from Brian Berkeley, he pulled it down.</P>




<B><P>A 47.27</B>&#9;Did he? Vandal!  Are those two little cottages where Miss Tye used to live, Annie Tye, they backed on to the school, one cottage, there’s lots of things gone isn’t it?  Lots of little cottages and that gone, the ones by the chapel, where they used to collect the waste paper during the war by the George.  They used to collect it in a truck then the WRVS used to sort it, and that’s how they bought the bus shelter wasn’t it?  I think that’s what I’ve heard anyway.  </P>
<B><P>&#9;</B>Why did we used to go there? To bible class I<B> </B>think, and we went to Miss Cadwallader’s I think it was.  We went there to bible class and we used to go down to Miss Macklin and Miss Macklin used to ride a three wheeled tricycle, and she used to have a hat with a veil on, to keep the hat on, and we went here once and there was a thunder storm and I suppose being stupid, at our age, we said we were frightened to do something, and she said if you don’t believe in the Evil One you will be all right, so we went home.  I think we were a bit naughty with her really, looking back.</P>

<B><P>Q 49.56</B>&#9;Patty Mitcheson?</P>
<B><P>A 49.57</B>&#9;Oh yes, Patty Mitcheson, she was a Sunday school teacher.  Then there used to be Mrs Eardley, Mrs Gardiner, and one girl and one boy, Mrs Waddington-Jones, I was trying to think who lived on the end, I can’t remember..</P>
