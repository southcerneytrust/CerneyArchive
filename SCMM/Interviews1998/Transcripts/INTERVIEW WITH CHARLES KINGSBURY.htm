<B><U><P>INTERVIEW WITH CHARLES KINGSBURY</P>

</B></U><FONT SIZE=2><P>Tape 19</P>
</FONT>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>Q 21.19&#9;</B>Can you just give us your name and where you came from?</P>
<B><P>A 21.23&#9;</B>My name is Charles Kingsbury, where we came from when we moved to the village was Lancashire, from a small town south of Preston, but originally I was born in London, so we have travelled about a lot over the years.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 21.42</B>&#9;What made you choose South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 21.44</B>&#9;Because we had links over very many years with South Cerney.  I used to go to school here in the village,  when the school was in School Lane, when I was 4,5,6, because my father was in the RAF and my father was stationed at South Cerney at the RAF Camp.  Over the years my father was posted back here, so we have had various contacts with the village for many years.  Then 27 years ago, we got married in the church here, because mum and dad had actually retired by then and bought a house in the village.  So our contacts with the village, I’m 50 now, so they go back 45 years on and off, we’ve been here 10 years this time since we bought the post office.</P>

<B><P>Q 22.44</B>&#9;Tell me about Ann Edwards School</P>
<B><P>A 22.46</B>&#9;Well it wasn’t Ann Edwards then, as far as I know. I can’t remember, but Mr Peyman was our headmaster, and main teacher.  You can still go in the school in School Lane now, and see all the pegs about 3 feet high around the wall where we used to hang our coats; some names are on there.  We looked and looked, but I don’t think my name is there anymore, but you remember lots of things, one of them is having lunch in the school hall and things like that.  I’ve got certificates for the egg and spoon race, and various bits and pieces mum always kept over the years, I suppose those might make memories, but unfortunately I didn’t see Mr Peyman before he died, we didn’t go back to see him, but I still remember him.</P>

<B><P>Q 12.38</B>&#9;Was he strict?</P>
<B><P>A 23.40</B>&#9;I think he was a good teacher really, a good headmaster, I don’t think we ever thought of him as being strict, we just thought of him as a gentleman really.  I was only 5 or 6 or so, so it’s difficult to remember that far back.</P>

<B><P>Q 23.58</B>&#9;Tell me about your marriage</P>
<B><P>A 24.02</B>&#9;We got married here at the village church, All Hallows, Reverend Stacy-Lewis married us.  Mainly because I was working for the Ford Motor Company in Bristol, and my wife came from the north anyway, and it was either that we got married at that point in time, and it was convenient to come here because we had a base here, with mum and dad being here, or we put it off, but for us to be able to move to Bristol where I was working at the time, we decided to get married here, so we had just a little wedding, about 50 guests, and a reception round at the Royal Oak, before they had ever done anything like that before.  I know it was only 27 years ago, but it wasn’t that long ago, but it was very nice, just quiet and pleasant, just relatives and friends really.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 24.59</B>&#9;When you bought the post office, what sort of training does the post office give you?</P>
<B><P>A 25.05</B>&#9;We have specific training in the post office, it wasn’t very much in those days, even10 years ago, but it has improved greatly since then, but you usually  have a trainer come in and spend a week or two with you, and go through the main transactions and the paperwork, which is a lot really.  Then you are left to your own devices very much, very quickly and there’s always some help you can call, you are not totally alone, there is always a helpline on the other end of the phone which is very good and a trainer will come back and help you if you have got specific problems.  We were lucky inasmuch as we had Sue Ash here, who had worked in the post office as long as it had been in this building, so she was experienced, and that helped an awful lot, and she was almost full time then anyway with the previous owner, and that gave us a great insight into a lot of the complexities that post office work held for us really.</P>

<B><P>Q 26.11</B>&#9;Who is the Postmaster or Postmistress?</P>
<B><P>A 26.13</B>&#9;They call them postmasters always, whether they are male or female, funnily enough, but Selina is really the Postmistress/Postmaster, and I tend to look after the business more, the newsagency side of it, but we are both experienced in, so both of us work in the post office and Sue is there almost full time anyway.  So there are three of us running the post office side of things, as we need to, which is necessary, as it is so busy really.</P>

<B><P>Q 26.42</B>&#9;Has the turnover increased since you’ve been here?</P>
<B><P>A 26.46</B>&#9;Yes it has.  The post office side has stayed pretty steady, it has increased mainly because of inflation generally, I mean obviously prices go up, and that happens anyway, the level of business we do through the post office has increased, particularly with local businesses paying in and because we are a bank through Girobank as well.  On the newsagency side it has increased quite considerably, probably because in recent years of course, we have refitted the shop completely, and that made a difference, we put new products in, so whilst may of the existing products remained pretty steady, the new lines have helped to boost turnover a little bit.  More recently, in the last three years, we have had the lottery business, which helps considerably, because that brings people in, and the idea is that the extra flow of customers will buy extra items, not just the lottery.  And it does happen, our Saturday trade for instance, is probably 100% up on what it was when we first came here, more that a 100%, certainly in the last 5 years it has doubled, just on the one day, because Saturday is the main national lottery draw day.</P>

<B><P>Q 28.07</B>&#9;Has the Water Mark development made any difference to you?</P>
<B><P>A 28.14</B>&#9;It’s difficult to say, we see people from the Water Mark, but they come and go.  There are the permanent customers, the ones who own the properties, and they tend to be regular, but then a lot of those properties are rented out, on short term holiday lets and things like that.  Those people we tend not to see so often, they come and go very much.  It is difficult to know when a customer comes into your shop whether they come from Water Mark or some other holiday complex or campsite around the area.  When Cotswold Hoburne is busy, we are busy obviously, but a lot of our trade is very steady it’s not passing trade, you get the passing trade, but it’s very steady local trade really, which is good from our point of view.</P>

<B><P>Q 29.13</B>&#9;Inaudible</P>
<B><P>A 29.16</B>&#9;The business side is of interest obviously, and it’s always interesting to hear a success story and turnover has increased and everything else, because of efforts, especially when we have so much pressure on this sort of business. Places like Tesco opening and everywhere else, there’s always competition around the area, but from the post office point of view, it is strong because we have a post office, but it’s not only that its because of the support we get in the village, its not just us being here and our efforts really, it’s the villages themselves, they want it.  I don’t know how they influence other businesses in the village, I know some have come and gone.  We are continually getting bakeries, and they come and go unfortunately, but from our point of view we get a lot of support, and it works both ways.  A business has to be supported particularly in a village, or it would die otherwise.  I quite often say to people when the say what is it like running a small village post office and shop, and I think on a Thursday morning when the elderly people are coming in to pick up their pensions and benefits and you stop in the middle of the shop and listen to the conversations that are going on, you think to yourself you don’t really own the place. We’re just caretakers, because we couldn’t close it, it is really so much part of the community the post office, and it happens everywhere, not just here, but particularly in South Cerney, I think it is good to see that such a focal point is supported so well.  Whenever we get</P>
<P>&#9;questionnaires from the post office for our customers, everybody is so concerned that they are not going to lose the post office, they’re so concerned about keeping it here and having the facility, but it’s not just the old people, it’s the youngsters as well.  We do a lot of personal banking business with Girobank and a lot of people have Girobank accounts, and they would lose the facility of being able to bank all hours really, compared to the other big four banks, but also local businesses also use that banking facility, so it isn’t just a case of old people using it and wanting it, I think there is a hardcore of modern current generation up  to date individuals who want a post office and have a need for it.  A lot of that shows in the commitment that the post office and the Government are putting into Post Office Counters with automation and new business that is coming through like insurance and foreign exchange and things like this a lot of more personal banking, things like that show a commitment from the Government and Post Office Counters, but it’s goo to see in being supported by the local community, that’s the most important thing.  We wouldn’t be here if they weren’t out there as well, I know that’s obvious, but it really has to work in the village because of the many outside pressures.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 32.42</B>&#9;Do you and Selina find it hard working such long hours?</P>
<B><P>A 32.45</B>&#9;Yes we do, it is difficult to have a life sometimes, we are open from six in the morning until six at night, and later on lottery days, and then Sunday’s a half day so we close at 12 o’clock on a Sunday, and that can get a bit wearing, more than a bit wearing sometimes.  I don’t mind getting, that’s no problem at all, I’d rather be busy than doing nothing at all.  So I think I thrive on it, but every so often I think we have to crash out and stop and just have a couple of days off, we try to get a day of in the week, but it doesn’t always work, especially during the summer when everybody is on holiday.  But there again w are lucky that we have staff in the shop, who know how to run it, so if we want to go away they can run the whole business including the post office, and they are local people.  They are families, we know the families, so they don’t come and go, we don’t have a high staff turnover, they stay, the customers know them and that’s a big benefit, they know them from a personal point of view, they see them in the village they see them in the pubs, the see them walking around.  So that helps us a lot, I think when we first came we thought we could do a lot more on our own, take over some of the roles that the others were doing, but we found that we couldn’t.  We’ve kept all the staff on that we originally had, some have come and gone obviously, but all the positions are still there and that provides local benefit, it puts something back into the village as well.  It helps us an awful lot really, it keeps us sane sometimes because in your own business you can work 24 hours a day, sometimes you’ve just got to say enough is enough and stop, but it can be wearing.</P>

<B><P>Q 34.46</B>&#9;Has the photocopier been worthwhile?</P>
<B><P>A 34.48&#9;</B>Yes, it needs replacing now, because it gets all sort of use, and it will be replaced in the next couple of months, but that and faxing, the fax machine is used every day, it’s amazing who uses photocopiers and fax machines, it’s not just the young, hi-tech modern generation at all, everybody wants to photocopy any letter they send to the bank or a knitting pattern or something like that, it’s amazing what gets photocopied and as far as faxing is concerned a lot of people in the village have relatives, particularly sons and daughters overseas, and they find that it is so much more fun sending a fax, if nothing else, birthday or Christmas or whatever, even just ordinary letters really go through.  You get local businesses as well, some people who just don’t invest in anything like that in their own homes, and run maybe a travel club from home, and they get a lot of quotes from Germany, Austria, France and places and they come in directly here usually, so people, we find use the technology a more, even in a village like this.</P>

<B><P>Q 36.06</B>&#9;Do you think the idea of giving a CD-ROM to all the school children is a good one?</P>
<B><P>A 36.12</B>&#9;Yes I think it’s very good, putting a CD-ROM out for the millennium for South Cerney is a super idea, you’re using the right medium for a start obviously, most up to date.  I think it would make it fun for everybody to use, old or young and of course you can get so much information on it really, and it’s easily accessible so it’s not like some of our old technology where you skip about from place to place, because you can skip about very easily on a CD.  So I think it’s an excellent idea, I think it’s a real marker to the village for the future.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 36.58</B>&#9;Have you had children here, who’ve been educated here?</P>
<B><P>A 37.04</B>&#9;Yes, we’ve only got one daughter, Sarah, she was 12 when we came , she’s 22 now and just moved away, but very much in touch, so her teenage years were here, and she obviously went to Kingshill; she went through her GCSE’s and A levels, then went to Cirencester College, Stroud College for a short time and then she landed on her feet and got a job with Apex, which as you know is in Broadway Lane just outside the village. A computer firm and got on very well there, and she’s only just moved, she’s been there for two years, so she’s been very much educated and started her working life in the area, which is very lucky compared to what a lot of children have had to put up with in recent years.</P>

<B><P>Q 37.58</B>&#9;Were you happy about bringing her up in this area?</P>
<B><P>A 38.02</B>&#9;Yes, very much so.  We were happy where we were in Lancashire, there was nothing wrong with that, but the climate is a lot milder here anyway for a start and this is a more affluent area I suppose, and you do see differences between north and south, I don’t care what anybody says but we’ve been quite happy.  I think the standard of schools vary from place to place, and I’m not sure that the standards in this area are any better particularly that some of the places we’ve been, but by and large we’ve been quite satisfied.</P>

<B><P>Q 38.55</B>&#9;There can’t be many post offices with flowers, who does them?</P>
<B><P>A 38.57</B>&#9;They are just little things that Selina does, all the girls are good though like that, it’s no good asking us men really, we tend to notice things and think that’s nice, but we never notice how they get there, but Selina’s the greenfingers, the garden is full of flowers, and all she does is bring them in regularly, especially this time of year.  It brightens it up, and it’s amazing how many people notice them.  People enjoy seeing them, a lot of people surreptitiously go up and feel them, they’re not sure if they are silk or plastic or something.  They say what are they, but it’s no good them asking me; if the girls are there they know.  But she enjoys and other people enjoy it as well.</P>

<B><P>Q 39.48</B>&#9;Do many people look at the books……..?</P>
<B><P>A 40.06</B>&#9;We haven’t had a diary recently, not this year, not a lot of people do that, and I think it’s a shame, but as far as the millennium book is concerned, people do use it, people have been writing things in it, it gets taken away  every so often for the committee to have a look at.  But it’s like everything else isn’t it, people tend to leave things to the last minute.   You’ll probably get an influx of ideas and suggestions from people right at the last minute when they suddenly realise that the time is upon them.  A lot of people are shy as well about speak up or writing things down which is a shame, but the post office is an ideal focal point for this sort of thing, it’s just that I don’t think a lot of people realise they can do it there.  It’s difficult to remind people as well, all the time when your serving.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 41.00</B>&#9;Do you have any problems with kids?</P>
<B><P>A 41.02</B>&#9;What in the business, in the shop? No.  There are always the bad few in any community I suppose, and you tend to recognise them.  I think because we get most people through our doors who live in the village, you know the families as well so you get to know the parents, so if there is any trouble and we’ve never had any serious trouble, not what I would call serious trouble, if there is any serious trouble, the parents usually get to find out , and it'’ usually quite harmless.  We employ 15 or so youngsters as paper boys and girls, and they stay with us from the earlier stage, they start at 13 until they do their A levels, many of them, and that helps an awful lot, you get to know an awful lot of families that way.  And they are always enthusiastic; kids today are great, they have lots of pressures on them, but they put up with a lot as well.</P>

<B>
<P>Q 42.30&#9;</B>Do you belong to any associations? </P>




<B><P>A 42.32</B>&#9;Well it’s difficult, a lot of people say you should belong to this or you should belong to that, but it’s getting the time and I really firmly believe that if I said I would do something, like standing for the Parish Council or belonging to some committee or something else.  If people are going to rely on you for that then  I’ve got to give the time and make the commitment, so I’ve tended not to, I’ve tended to steer clear, maybe one day, when I‘ve got more time I can do something about it, but quite honestly by the time I’ve got any spare time in the evening, if I sit down I’m exhausted; I’m not getting any younger, I could do it ten years ago, even keep on doing it, but now I just find I will just flake out, and I don’t think it’s very fair on other people so I tend to avoid it, but there’s one or two things I do, I suppose.  Selina mainly drags me into it, she’s in the Gardening Club and she does this and she does that, and potters about as much as possible, but we are both members of South Cerney Players, which I can’t remember how we got into, I think we got into helping them because they always need extra hands for building sets and things, and most of them are friends in the village and we got dragged into it a few years back and then a few pantomimes ago,  the producer/director suggested I had a part, and I think my first part was Sneezy in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which was a lot of fun, I think we all have a lot of fun in the rehearsals, probably more than in the performances, because there is an awful lot of tomfoolery that goes on, which upsets the producers and the director quite often, but it’s quite memorable at the same time.  But over the years we’ve done quite a bit really, the last performance I was a pirate with lots of kiddies in, and that was lots of fun and the last one I didn’t actually have a speaking part, because I have great difficulty in learning my lines, so a lot of people say don’t give him a speaking part, because I always leave it till the last minute to learn my lines and everybody else’s cues go and I forget mine, or I say something different, so the last time they gave me a part as a body, and I was dead for the whole play virtually, which suited a lot of people because I didn’t have to say anything, but there were certainly individuals who loved it because they kept hanging me on a hook as well on the back of a wardrobe door.  It was a farce, one of these political farces, a bit like Brian Rix, and I was the body which woke up eventually, they thought I was dead.  I was a lot of fun, I enjoyed that and it’s not too often, maybe twice a year perhaps, so it’s not too intensive, so apart from rehearsals I can manage the time, and not let anybody down really.  Apart from South Cerney Players the only real sport I do, I go skiing once a year.  There is a group of us in the village actually, we go skiing, it’s men only I have to say which is very chauvinist, but I don’t think the girls want to come anyway, it’s quite intensive, we ski solidly every day.  I know a lot of people think we don’t, but we do, there is no excuse you can’t get up in the morning, no matter how heavy the night before was, but there is a lot of fun.  Last year 30 of us went so they come from other villages, not just this one, but there is a hardcore from South Cerney.  We always go to the same place, we go to Austria, and it’s lovely, because Austria is still very quaint, and you can only do it for a week, because you are up all night practically and you ski every day, but it’s serious stuff.  I used to ski when I was very young then I started again in the last 4 or 5 years, and you find you don’t forget it, and I really enjoy that, but that’s about my only sporting outlet.</P>
