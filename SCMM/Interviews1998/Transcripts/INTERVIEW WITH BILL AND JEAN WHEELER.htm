<B><P>A (0.49)&#9;&#9;&#9;</B>In School lane, my mother and father.  I was actually born at No3 Highnam Cottages.</P>





<B><P>Q (1.03)&#9;&#9;</B>Where did you go to school?<B>&#9;&#9;</P>
<P>A (1.05)&#9;&#9;</B>South Cerney C of E</P>

<B><P>Q (1.09)&#9;&#9;</B>Who was the schoolmaster?&#9;</P>




<B><P>A  (1.13)&#9;</B>The schoolmaster originally was Mr Rigall who changed to Mr Peyman about 5 years after I started I suppose.</P>





<B><P>Q (1.23)</B>&#9;&#9;What were they like?</P>
<B><P>A (1.25)</B>&#9;&#9;Very strict, good teachers</P>

<B><P>Q (1.29)&#9;</B>&#9;What were lessons like?</P>
<B><P>A</B> <B>(1.31)&#9;&#9;</B>Quite good.</P>

<B><P>Q (1.32)</B>&#9;&#9;Can you remember a typical day at school?</P>




<B><P>A (1.37)</B>&#9;Yes, it was during the war years, a typical day at school would have been walking up from here to the school early in the morning for 9 o’clock.  Arithmetic was usually the first subject then you went through the day, geography, the usual run of things and very very easy going.</P>





<B><P>Q (2.05)&#9;</B>&#9;All in one class?</P>
<B><P>A (2.07)</B>&#9;&#9;Yes</P>

<B><P>Q (2.11)&#9;</B>&#9;What did you wear to school?</P>
<B><P>A (2.15)</B>&#9;&#9;A little blazer I think and short grey trousers</P>





<B><P>Q (2.22)</B>&#9;What was it like in the holidays as a child, where did you play and what did you play at? </P>
<B><P>A (2.27)&#9;</B>Usually the gravel pits, swimming in the gravel pits or walking by the canal, things like that. </P>
<B>
<P>Q (2.37)&#9;</B>What games did other children play?</P>
<B><P>A (2.38)&#9;</B>In those days of course it was tops and rounders and that sort of thing, we could play in the road all day because there wasn’t much traffic at all.</P>
<B>
</B><P>Very quite except for aircraft flying overhead because South Cerney number one flying school was there of course and lots of crashes etc</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>




<B><P>Q (3.01)</B>&#9;&#9;Tell me about the crashes</P>




<B><P>A (3.03)</B>&#9;Well normally you would get one every two or three months, because they were training people who had never flown before to go off to war and of course they would periodically crash and then you had Down Ampney, usually paratroops practising so it was very hectic really, especially in the air.</P>

<B><P>Q (3.27)</B>&#9;Do you have any other memories of the war?</P>
<B><P>A (3.32)</B>&#9;Not really not a terrible lot because it was so quiet here except for South Cerney station was attacked early one morning and the RAF camp was attacked.  Nothing too horrific just a hell of a loud bang when they dropped the bombs and another one of course in Cerney Wick round about the same time.</P>

<B><P>Q (4.00)</B>&#9;Were there any anti aircraft batteries anywhere?</P>
<B><P>A (4.02)</B>&#9;Yes, in the Downings for a short period, about two or three months I suppose something like that.  I can remember whether it was a light ACAC or a heavy ACAC, but there definitely was an ACAC battery down there.</P>

<B><P>Q (4.15)</B>&#9;Very near the village?</P>
<B><P>A (4.16)</B>&#9;Yes and of course not far from the aerodrome that they used to attack just on odd occasions.</P>

<B><P>Q (4.29)</B>&#9;Can you remember anything about the village hall dances?</P>
<B><P>A (4.32)</B>&#9;Yes I think it was Friday evenings, an association had formed for troops coming back after the war to give them a little present and usually could be bands from the RAF camp, very good bands some of them because you had a lot of professional people so you could have anyone there.  I remember a Joe Loss drummer was playing with the band there, it was a Glen Miller type thing and that first started me with Jazz actually. First interest.</P>

<B><P>Q (5.14)</B>&#9;That’s your main interest?</P>
<B><P>A (5.15)</B>&#9;Yes</P>

<B><P>Q (5.18)</B>&#9;What is the name of your house?</P>
<B><P>A (5.20)</B>&#9;Ellington</P>

<B><P>Q (5.21)</B>&#9;Did you play an instrument yourself?</P>
<B><P>A (5.22)</B>&#9;No I just used to tinker about on the drums, but never really successfully.</P>

<B><P>Q (5.30)&#9;</B>Did you know any of the clergy widows at the college<B>&#9;</P>
<P>A (5.32)&#9;</B>Yes, one or two, Miss Hall, well Miss Hall wasn’t a widow, but there was Miss hall a lot of the names escape me now, but I did know everyone in all twelve at one period.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (5.53)&#9;</B>You told me you lived in School Lane with your Grandmother at one stage</P>
<B><P>A (5.57)&#9;</B>I left home at 14 and went to live with gran for company after gramp died and we stopped there until we built this place actually.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q (6.11)&#9;</B>Do you remember any of the characters in school lane?</P>
<B><P>A (6.12)&#9;</B>Arthur Painter the blacksmith – he was the main one, and Jock Plain and one or two others.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (6.26)&#9;</B>Did you as a child go and visit the smithy?</P>
<B><P>A (6.28)&#9;</B>We used to stand and watch there, but the language was pretty bad and he was a bad tempered chap, so we didn’t stop there too long.</P>

<B><P>Q (6.38)&#9;</B>What about the mill?</P>
<B><P>A (6.40)&#9;</B> Yes I can remember the mill, it wasn’t operational in those days but we used to play in there sometimes.</P>

<B><P>Q (6.51)&#9;</B>What was the condition of the village after the war?</P>
<B><P>A (6.53)&#9;</B>About the same as it is now, but much smaller, very quiet. much quieter than it is today of course, no housing estates or anything I think it was always a large village supposedly the largest in Gloucestershire I think but much quieter than it is today.</P>

<B><P>Q (7.20)&#9;</B>Were people better off before the war do you think, or now?</P>
<B><P>A (7.24)&#9;</B>I think people were much more contented, but financially we are much better off now.</P>

<B><P>Q (7.34)&#9;</B>What trade did you yourself choose?</P>




<B><P>A (7.36)&#9;&#9;</B>Electrician.</P>





<B><P>Q (7.40)&#9;</B>Where did you do your apprenticeship?</P>
<B><P>A (7.43)&#9;</B>At the Wessex Company in Cirencester, before it was nationalised to<B> </B>the SEB</P>
<B>
<P>Q (7.52)&#9;</B>Did you work for a firm or for yourself?</P>
<B><P>A (7.24)&#9;</B>I stopped there for two years then I moved to Johnson and Harding, a local firm, and finished my apprenticeship until National Service&#9;</P>

<B><P>Q (8.05)&#9;</B>Where did you do your National Service?</P>




<B><P>A (8.06)&#9;&#9;</B>Lingfield in Surrey, mostly.</P>





<B><P>Q (8.11)&#9;</B>The what?</P>




<B><P>A (8.13)&#9;&#9;</B>Came back and married Jean, and eventually formed my own business.</P>





<B><P>Q (8.24)&#9;</B>When did the modern building in the village first start?</P>
<B><P>A (8.26)&#9;</B>I suppose about 1958, something like that.  Meadow Way started it could have been a little bit later, it was round about then that things started to move, then the main estates started coming in, I think Sudeley Drive would have been the next and then on down further to Oak Way.  They were the major estates, private houses of course, there were quite a lot of private houses built.  This originally was an orchard.</P>
<P>There was an anti-aircraft battery in the Downings and also of course the school, we had our own air raid shelters made from Norcon pipes and covered with dirt and weed s for camouflage, and it the siren went on Bradley’s crane you all rushed into the pipes, but I was dead lucky because I used to dash out of the gate and run down to Gran’s which was just two blocks away.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q (9.48)&#9;</B>You talked to me also about Mr Painter at the mill, can you<B> </B>remember if<B> </B>there was another Painter?</P>
<B><P>A (9.56) &#9;</B>Yes, my ancestors lived the in the mill, originally, of course I can’t remember that but they did live in the upper mill</P>
<B>




<P>Q (10.07)&#9;</B>What name?</P>




<B><P>A (10.08)&#9;</B>Painter.</P>
<B>
</FONT><P>ENTER JEAN</P>
</B><FONT SIZE=2>




<B><P>Q (10.17)&#9;</B>When did you first see Bill?</P>




<B><P>A (10.18)&#9;</B>I saw Bill first in Cirencester and in those days if you fancied somebody that was it and then I cam out to the local flower show in South Cerney, which was a good do in those days, a huge marquee with sports and everything else and Bill was playing football for the local side and we started chatting and made dates from there on.</P>





<B><P>Q (10.39)&#9;</B>Where did you get married?</P>
<B><P>A (10.41)&#9;</B>Watermoor Church in Cirencester.</P>

<B><P>Q (10.50)&#9;</B>Describe the old flower shows</P>




<B><P>A (10.52)&#9;</B>The flower show in the village was lovely in those days, people used to come from miles around, there was a huge marquee full of flowers and the Women’s Institute, all the local women put in cakes etc.  There were sports, cycling races.  It was a really good show.  The day I met Bill it poured with rain all day and I got wet through.</P>





<B><P>Q (11.21)&#9;</B>You’ve brought up how many children?</P>
<B><P>A (11.22)&#9;</B>We have two boys</P>

<B><P>Q (11.26)&#9;</B>They went to school here?</P>




<B><P>A (11.28)&#9;</B>The eldest, Dean, started at the school in school lane, after that the new school was built so Mark started at the new school, but they were both lucky to have a nice little school in those days.</P>
<B>




<P>Q (11.42)&#9;</B>Do you think it’s a good pace to bring up children in South Cerney?</P>




<B><P>A (11.44)&#9;</B>Oh yes, very good, up until lately there was never any trouble with stealing.  You get the odd thing now but we’ve always been very lucky.</P>
<B><P>&#9;</B>And the boys, when they were growing up they had a very good youth club in the village, which they attended.  </P>
<P>&#9;They spent most of their time fishing, get up at 3.00am and go off for the day.</P>





<B><P>Q (12.11)&#9;</B>Do you think nowadays that people would hesitate to do that?</P>




<B><P>A (12.14)&#9;</B>Yes, I think people don’t want to get involved in things and children haven’t got the freedom tat we had.  You couldn’t send two boys of 10 and 8 down to the gravel pits now because you would be a bit nervous of them going on their own, but we felt quite confident in those days to let them go and take their flask and sandwiches and sit down there all day fishing and knew they were quite safe because the men down there were quite helpful to them as well.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>




<P>Q (12.44)&#9;</B>What message would you have for the future for people in South Cerney?</P>




<B><P>A (12.53)</B>&#9;Do plenty of walking and things that they don’t do now because of television there is plenty to do.  You can walk for miles and miles actually.  You’ve got the canal and all round the gravel pits.  Cycling, which we do on mountain bikes.</P>

<B><P>Q (13.15)&#9;</B>Do you think Cotswold Water Park should be better preserved and protected?</P>
<B><P>A (13.21)&#9;</B>Yes, I think so personally, I think we’ve got enough houses, and it would be nice to just keep it as walks and for the animals and birds etc.</P>





<B><P>Q (13.43)&#9;</B>Tell me about the hall and your family.</P>




<B><P>A (13.47)&#9;</B>Grampy originally used it as a barn and his fields in those days was where the airfield was built later on.  He rented all those fields I believe at the top, probably owned by Bathurst, I don’t know.  That was his farm and that was his barn that he used.</P>

<B><P>A (14.30)&#9;</B>The village hall was grampy’s barn originally and his land was the old South Cerney aerodrome as it is now which was big fields and he farmed there for quite a few years.</P>





<B><P>Q (14.41)&#9;</B>Where they still working the quarry up there?</P>
<B><P>A (14.48)&#9;</B>You mean the red brick quarry? No<B>.&#9;</P>
</B>
<B><P>Q (14.56)&#9;</B>The quarry halfway up Wildmoor Lane</P>




<B><P>A (14.58)&#9;</B>No I don’t think so, not then.  That was long before my time. There was a brick yard<B> </B>half way up the Cirencester Road owned by ancestors of mine, I don’t know just when they stopped but they did make red bricks there for local buildings I suppose.</P>
