<B><U><P>INTERVIEW WITH RICHARD BRADLEY</P>
</U><P> </P>
<P>Q 21.26&#9;</B>Where did your family come from?</P>
<B><P>A 21.30&#9;</B>Originally from Oxford, my grandfather was a small speculative builder, and he moved to Swindon to take up a job as a general foreman for a Swindon contractor; the contractor went broke, whether that was due to my grandfather’s efforts, I can’t say.  Then he started again as a speculative builder in Swindon.  The business was built up; they opened a stone quarry at Swindon at Okus, adjacent to the site of the present Princess Margaret Hospital.  They quarried the stone and they crushed it, they had a crushing tower there and they also had a lime kiln, so they made their own mortar.  My father was in the First World War and was very concerned with transport in that war, and of course when he came home he used his expertise and knowledge to build up a fleet of lorries, wagons as we called them.  In about 1925 the business of stone quarrying and crushing the stone was being affected by a local competitor, by the name of Hills of Swindon, who arrived in South Cerney in about 1925, and were bringing the gravel into Swindon, which was affecting, the competition was too great for our stone quarrying business, so in 1926 my father acquired 2 acres of land in the village of South Cerney opposite the cross, and I remember him telling me that my grandfather said now that will keep you going, you’ll never dig that lot out, but of course with the advent of the steam navvy and the mechanical shovels, which were just becoming into use in those days, he excavated this 2 acres of land in about 6 months I suppose.  As a result of this he persuaded his father that they needed more, and he bought Ham Farm.  They built a washing plant and also they conveyed the gravel from the working face to the washing plant in mechanical skips on a track just like a miniature railway, I remember that, and also they built over here a block making plant, so we went into the business of making precast concrete blocks which again became a very important part of the business, so the business was then in two main parts, one was the gravel and the manufacture of concrete products and the other was speculative building. Over those years they had always built houses in Swindon, Chippenham, Melksham and various other sites.  Interestingly enough they also had a contract for raising the stones and setting them up for Avebury, for which we have photographic evidence, that was by and large the history of the company’s operation in South Cerney.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 26.22&#9;</B>When you said setting up was it because the lifting machinery…..?</P>
<B><P>A 26.29&#9;</B>Yes, the gravel was dug with drag line excavators Rushton Busirus(?) was the make of machine we used over the years, and they were a very large bucket, capable of lifting about one ton of gravel at each time they threw the bucket out into the lake.  As the water table around here is very close to the surface, about 3 or 4 feet below, every time you dug into the ground you formed a lake, and that is why we have all these lakes round here.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 27.16</B>&#9;One thing that has always puzzled me, do you get a licence to dig gravel or do you buy the land …………?</P>
<B><P>A 27.19</B>&#9;I believe in the early days in the 20’s and 30’s I don’t believe planning permission was necessary, but certainly it is now.  If you were to buy any land around here now that was gravel bearing you’d need planning permission and that is depending on circumstances, very difficult to obtain now.</P>

<B><P>Q 27.55</B>&#9;Is the gravel extraction still continuing?</P>
<B><P>A 28.01</B>&#9;Yes it is indeed, there are certain reserves around here still remaining, but I would say there are not many more years of available reserves left in the district now, it is virtually worked out, because those areas that are still gravel bearing would not be allowed planning permission because of their situation close to the villages or for various environmental reasons.</P>

<B><P>Q 28.38&#9;</B>Tell me a bit more about creating various types of artificial …..?</P>
<B><P>A 29.18&#9;</B>The company had started making concrete blocks, just ordinary concrete blocks for construction purposes, then we started in the 30’s making what we called a rock face block, which is an imitation stone block of which there is plenty of evidence around the countryside now, but after the Second World War there was a company at Tetbury making what we call reconstructed stone, and what we did was to virtually copy this and started making on our own account and marketing under the name of Bradstone.  We developed this in various forms and very successfully over the years, and it became, because of the nature of the Cotswold countryside the planners wanted to try and retain the nature of the Cotswold buildings, and this was just about the nearest to the natural Cotswold stone, although in my opinion nothing ever quite matches Cotswold stone.  But anyway the planners found this acceptable and for this reason it was widely used throughout the Cotswolds.  We also developed an artificial Cotswold stone tile, which in some people’s opinion is remarkably like the real and natural stone tile, or slate, more correctly.</P>

<B><P>Q 31.24</B>&#9;Did you know anything about the slate quarry being opened up at Filkins? </P>
<B><P>A 31.31</B>&#9;No, Redlands is a manufactured tile, but it really didn’t tend to compete with our reconstructed Cotswold stone tile.</P>

<B><P>Q 32.13</B>&#9;How did the number of people you employed increase…..?</P>
<B><P>A 32.23</B>&#9;It was particularly the manufacture of the reconstructed Cotswold stone and the concrete blocks, that in the 40’s, 50’s and 60’s was very labour intensive, particularly the reconstructed stone, which was all manufactured in moulds which had to be assembled, filled, the concrete was then cured and it had to be stripped.  It was very hard work and very intensive, so we employed many hundreds of people in the manufacture of this reconstructed Cotswold stone.</P>

<B><P>Q 33.07</B>&#9;Roughly how many?</P>
<B><P>A 33.10</B>&#9;I would say about 250 were employed locally in the manufacture of reconstructed stone.</P>

<B><P>Q 33.19</B>&#9;What proportion of those would come from South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 33.22</B>&#9;I would say 30 or 40 were from South Cerney, many from Cirencester, Fairford, some from Swindon, surrounding countryside.</P>

<LI>We’ve used some of the tiles on part of the barn next door, which the planners in their wisdom allowed us to use because it is south facing away from the road, but otherwise it is all natural stone tiles.</LI></OL>
</OL>






<B><P>Q 34.21</B>&#9;We you finished extracting…………………….?</P>
<B><P>A 34.25</B>&#9;When we’d finished extracting the gravel from the lakes there was a fair amount of natural vegetation, the withies started to grow round, we did some landscaping of the banks to shape them to make it easier for sporting facilities.  Boating, sailing particularly, and most of the recreational uses were, as I said, sailing and angling.  Angling has always been very popular around here.  Ironically when I was a lad I used to cycle all the way from Swindon for a day’s angling now it’s at the bottom of the garden I never bother.</P>

<B><P>Q 35.21</B>&#9;Do you recall any particularly interesting archeological things….?</P>
<B><P>Q 35.29</B>&#9;Yes, one or two.  We have had a stone coffin which I believe dates from Roman times although I can’t be sure about that and I believe that is in the local museum.  Also a grindstone for milling corn and I believe they have discovered some remains of prehistoric animals here.  My recollection of these is very hazy I’m afraid.</P>

<B><P>Q 36.02</B>&#9;There was a woolly rhinoceros dug up</P>
<B><P>A 36.05</B>&#9;Yes I believe there was.</P>

<B><P>Q 36.12</B>&#9;The archeology is part of the history, are there any other historic…..?</P>
<B><P>A 36.23</B>&#9;Not that I can recall, no.</P>

<B><P>Q 36.31</B>&#9;Bradley’s is now Camas?</P>
<B><P>A 36.35</B>&#9;The company was sold 15 years ago to English China Clays.</P>

<B><P>Q 36.47</B>&#9;Would you like to describe the house?</P>
<B><P>A 36.50</B>&#9;Yes, this part we are in front of now was a barn and at the west end that was a farm cottage attached to the barn, we actually kept pigs in the cottage before my father renovated the property in 1953, and when my mother died some 15 years ago, my wife suggested that we might move into it, so we did.  We have made a few alterations to it ourselves.  This on the left here was a garage, a double garage, which we’ve converted into a kitchen, and one or two other things we’ve added, and what was a kitchen at the west end is now my study.</P>

<B><P>Q 38.00</B>&#9;The actual old stone…….?</P>
<B><P>A 38.05</B>&#9;The building was in such poor condition that it was virtually re-built, there is an original part of the building still visible.</P>

<B><P>Q 38.20</B>&#9;Where’s that?</P>
<B><P>A 38.23</B>&#9;It’s on the north side, on the north-facing wall.</P>

<B><P>Q 38.28</B>&#9;Did you re-use the stone?</P>
<B><P>A 38.30</B>&#9;Yes we did, we’ve had to bring in some stone, but it was mostly from the original barn and cottage.</P>

<B><P>Q 38.41</B>&#9;Was your father his own architect?</P>
<B><P>A 38.43</B>&#9;No he employed an architect for the design.</P>

<B><P>Q 38.53</B>&#9;No names, no pack drill?</P>
<B><P>A 38.55</B>&#9;I can’t remember the name of the architect, but he was in fact a builder as well. He’d retired from the north of England and moved down here, and my father got to know him and they got together and decided to build.</P>

<B><P>Q 39.19</B>&#9;It’s not the Berkeley’s?</P>
<B><P>A 39.24</B>&#9;No it wasn’t Berkeley’s.  A local builder called Jim Keen did the stone tiled roof, I remember that.</P>

<B><P>Q 39.49</B>&#9;The date was it roughly 20’s, early 1930’s or was it later?</P>
<B><P>A 39.54</B>&#9;The building was converted in 1953.  Restored in 1953.  My own house was built in 1958, that’s Greystones, which is just off Station Road, which is all in Bradstone, reconstructed Bradstone, but on that the tiles are natural stone, because that was before we started to manufacture our own reconstructed artificial tiles.  </P>

<B><P>Q 40.36</B>&#9;Who owns it now?</P>
<B><P>A 40.40</B>&#9;A retired farmer, Norman and Diana Webb.</P>
