<B><P>Q 23.25&#9;&#9;</B>Just give me a brief biography of where you were born</P>




<B><P>A 23.39&#9;</B>I was born in<B> </B>Cirencester in 1927, in Somerford Road in my parents’ house, and after going to school on Malvern and Sherborne, I did my technical training in Manchester at the College of Technology.  I came back and spent 5 years at Eric Cole and partners as a quantity surveyor and eventually joined the family business in 1952, that’s it in a nutshell.</P>

<B><P>Q 24.17</B>&#9;Who was the first person in your family to establish a firm in South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 24.21&#9;</B>My father bought the business from Henry Fleetwood in the early 20’s and I believe folklore has it that he was in partnership with Norman Jewson at that time and they were known as Jewson &amp; Berkeley and there is the odd manhole cover around to this day with their name on it, that being the way that one normally put one’s trade mark on a house by having their name on the manhole covers.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 24.59&#9;</B>What were the principal houses built during the Jewson period by your father in South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 25.06&#9;</B>I shall have to rely very much on memory but they collaborated over a number of houses. Owlpen was one, which Norman Jewson owned for a short time then sold on, after the work was done I imagine, so he was a developer ahead of his time.  Rodmarton took 11 years to finish, that I do know, and we have got the photographs here so you can see what that was about, but that was a big, big job, the materials and everything.  The thing that is of interest to posterity, is that the material for the job were taken to Rodmarton by horse and cart which nowadays with mobile phones and speed of transport does seem to be quite a slow way of doing things, but that was the only way at that time.  Although I believe the firm did possess a steam lorry, which had a large fire under where the driver sat and that I believe was an early advance from the horse and cart era. </P>
<B>
<P>Q 27.07</B>&#9;Were some of the South Cerney workers working there, and what was their day like?</P>
<B><P>A 27.12&#9;</B>I should think undoubtedly, but the staff was recruited from over quite a wide area, from say, certainly Ampney Crucis to the Duntisbournes and south to Ashton Keynes and Minety, and they would think nothing of cycling to work in the morning, however many miles it was, and cycling home again at night and doing a full day’s work in between and woe betide them if they arrived late.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 27.51</B>&#9;How many workers were there during your father’s period?</P>
<B><P>A  27.58&#9;</B>It did at one time reach over 100, but that was only for a short time and in 1952 we were down to about 40, which was shrinking quite a lot, and by the time we ceased training in 1983 it had gone down to just over 20.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 28.24</B>&#9;Was there any particular reason that people were drawn away?</P>
<B><P>A 28.30</B>&#9;I always felt that the watershed for that was the opening of the Pressed Steel factory in Swindon, and that had an effect on demand for labour where men could go to get work, and it was to that that we first started losing men.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 28.58</B>&#9;Can you remember any of the individuals in South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 29.02&#9;</B>Yes, George Cox was the general foreman, his brother Frank was the joinery foreman, and Viv Cox, of course, who was Frank’s son, he followed on right to the very end, so there was quite a family continuity with a number of the men.  There was Bill Osborne, who was the son of Ernie Osborne, who came from Ashton Keynes, Sam Beard, the enormous Beard family of course, Sam Beard was the general foreman in my time towards the latter period, and his two sons, so there was a tremendous family feeling in that way.  Charlie Luker was a joiner and very good one, he and Ernie Osborne worked together in the old joiners shop, which I believe stands to this day unless the Beards have pulled it down, and it was prophesied that it would fall down back in about the 60’s by the Health &amp; Safety at work man who came round, so that forced us into building a new joiners shop, which very soon paid for itself in improved efficiency, which dragged us into the second half of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> Century very much, but Ernie Osborne and Charlie Luker worked up in the old joiners shop for years and years.  How they did it I don’t know, because the floorboards had great gaps in them and the wind blew through, quite unpleasant in the winter.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 31.22</B>&#9;What were the things that you worked on in South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 33.28&#9;</B>The village hall was a barn in School Lane<B> </B>and was converted from that into the hall and I remember that it was thatched by Collicut whose son later became the editor of the Wilts and Glos Standard, but he used to live two doors along from our yard in Silver Street and was a thatcher then, when very much more thatching was done in the area.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 34.29&#9;</B>Can you tell me which of the major houses were built during your father’s period?</P>
<B><P>A 34.40&#9;</B>There were a number, like Warrens Gorse at Perrott’s Brook, Aycot at Rendcomb, both for Aubrey Price and houses of that sort, like Grey Walls at the top of Burford Road, now the Hunter’s old people’s home and properties of that sort.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 35.38</B>&#9;Do you think they were very much in the 20’s and 30’s arts and crafts?</P>
<B><P>A 35.45&#9;</B>All this was the stuff on which I was brought up, as a boy of 14, 15, 16</P>
<P>&#9;And so although recollection is beginning to dim it was the start of my childhood and therefore I suppose it could be said that I was steeped in the traditions of that kind of work, and saw it going on, in South Cerney, the making of oak joinery and that sort of thing so it was a thing that I was brought up with.</P>

<B><P>Q 36.33</B>&#9;Do you think the arts and crafts were sort of cottage life, did you indeed know any of the arts and crafts people?</P>
<B><P>A 36.44</B>&#9;Not personally no, they would have been reaching the end of their life when I would have been starting mine.  Incidentally, I have thought of another house of major importance, that was Cotswold Farm for the Birchalls, it was built for Sir John Birchall and that really is a lovely house, and I’m sure Major Birchall would allow you to go and film that.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 37.29&#9;</B>Could you describe the vestry and the choir stalls<B> </B>in the church?</P>
<B><P>A 37.50</B>&#9;I think the design was one that my father did, certainly for the choir stalls, I think I’m right in saying that, then there was the vestry as well, both were his designs, which through his experience with working with arts and crafts people came naturally to him.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 38.22</B>&#9;Who was the joiner?</P>
<B><P>A 38.24&#9;</B>I think almost certainly Charlie Luker. Almost certainly, that is my recollection.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 38.33&#9;</B>Did your family have any connection with the society for the preservation of ancient buildings and the CPRE?</P>
<B><P>A 38.38&#9;</B>My father was a member of the CPRE for years, yes; ancient buildings, I don’t recall that he was, but he was chairman of the Cirencester Planning Committee for years.   He was chairman of the Urban District Council and had a big input with social housing as it is now called, council housing as we knew it in the town, in the years immediately after the war.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 39.22</B>&#9;Anything in South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 39.28</B>&#9;I should think the greatest contribution in that way was when the then Rural District Council bought the old gravel pit and built houses on it, but I don’t think there was much contribution to that side of housing by him at that time.  The gravel pit and the houses that were built on it, was worked out to a depth when they came down to the water, because the gravel was dug by hand they then gave up. There were not at that time excavators and drag line excavators with big buckets that would go down into the water and dig the gravel out, so when it came to building the houses, there wasn’t that great lake which would have precluded any kind of building. And of course I think that Berkeley Close is built on what was the gravel pit, although the firm that ran that side of things was called the Economic Concrete Company, and my father and Henry Fowler, who was my father’s clerk, ran that company between them. The interesting thing was that they were the forerunners of Bradley’s precast concrete and reconstructed stone enterprise and they had wooden moulds. When the wooden moulds wore out they gave up the idea of making reconstructed stone, and the rest as they say is history, but Bradley’s took over with metal moulds and there we are.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 41.38</B>&#9;Where was the office of the firm?</P>
<B><P>A 41.43&#9;</B>It was in Silver Street, Cotswold Cottage was the bit that you saw on the roadside and you entered through the opening next door and that opened out into quite a biggish yard, which we enlarged, because George Cox, who was the shop foreman, used to live in the house, and had the top of the yard as his vegetable garden, then when he moved out we dug out the vegetable garden, which was pretty well pure gravel, and put a garage for the lorry at the top there and that enlarged that quite considerably, and put a new petrol tank in.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 42.39</B>&#9;Do you remember against the wall to the school side the old master’s and mistress’s cottage?</P>
<B><P>A 42.49</B>&#9;I do, I remember it well, that was something that is one of the few entrepreneurial things that I can ever take credit for that when I heard that was to be pulled down we tendered for the job knowing that the only way that the stone could be got out was through our yard, so my price for the demolition included the making of the hole between the back wall and our yard, so we pulled the two cottages down and kept all the stone and that lasted us for many years and then built the wall back up again. That was quite a nice little job.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 43.45</B>&#9;Which of the houses in your own period are you most proud of?</P>
<B><P>A 44.05</B>&#9;I think the job that I’m most proud of is Lower Berry Town Farm which is between Blunsdon and Highworth and the architect for that was Russell Cox, and halfway through Russell Cox had an argument with the Barkers, who were paying the bill, and they dispensed with him and at my suggestion Tony Sanford from Poulton took over as architect, and we built an orangery on the side of the house, which he designed, and he was the architect for this, where we are now talking.  He was an excellent architect, he designed the bookcase there and I did a number of jobs for him.  Another one was Tudor House at Oaksey, which was a very nice job.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 45.20</B>&#9;Who was the tenant?</P>
<B><P>A 45.24</B>&#9;John Ashton, who was a London solicitor, he’s moved out now, but we did a lot of work to that property and built a gazebo in the garden, and that was a nice job.</P>

<B><P>Q45.48</B>&#9;Most of what you have built, in your father’s albums are very traditional, what training, did they learn on the job?</P>
<B><P>A 46.00</B>&#9;We had as a rule about 6 apprentices at any time, which was quite a policy of the firm, that we should train staff and towards the end I must confess that the staff who were doing the training got a little bit tired of training boys who when they reached the end of their apprenticeship said thank you very much, I’ve been beautifully trained, I’ll now go and work for somebody else, and do piecework and that sort of thing, where they would be paid quite a lot of money for doing a job extremely quickly but based on the skill that they had been taught by the staff who worked for me.  So the thing was slightly on a self-destruct path, which was disappointing, because the men that were doing the training felt that they were giving their best, so that was disappointing.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 47.20</B>&#9;Where did the stone actually come from?</P>
<B><P>A 47.26</B>&#9;The dressed stone, a lot of it came from Farmington, some might have came from Bath, but the building stone for the walls mostly came from either the Chester-Master quarry up at the Whiteway, which can now been seen to great advantage where the bypass has been put through, or Iles Quarry up at Daglingworth I think.  And that has changed hands now, so it ceased to be Iles. </P>

<B><P>Q 48.17&#9;</B>Did you have any tied cottages with the firm?</P>
<B><P>A 48.20&#9;</B>Yes we did, we had two in Station Road in South Cerney and two of the staff lived there and stayed there for a number of years and raised their families there.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 48.43</B>&#9;What work did your firm do in Cirencester?</P>
<B><P>A 48.55</B>&#9;I suppose the biggest job that was done in Cirencester was probably the George V wing of the Royal Agricultural College and there are also the Alms House in Watermoor Road on the right as you are going south, and a number of commercial buildings, factories and so on.  So that the work we did was varied.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 49.38</B>&#9;What about the little square with the trees?</P>
<B><P>A 49.44</B>&#9;From pre-war days a lot of dressed stone was worked by banker masons in what used to be Timbrell’s yard, which now has houses built on it.  That was our second yard further along in the Cirencester direction down Silver Street, and the banker masons worked there on memorial crosses, and the lamp that is in the square in Dyer Street was one such, that was moved from the bottom of the Tetbury Road where it had originally been sited to Dyer Street in a new position.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 50.50</B>&#9;Unheard question</P>
<B><P>A 50.51</B>&#9;the reason for demolishing those cottages was the need to put in two terrapin classrooms I seem to recall, which couldn’t really be described as progress but I suppose in that in provided more accommodation for the pupils that was the aim of the Gloucestershire County Council education department.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 51.44</B>&#9;Your father asked for credit?</P>
<B><P>A 51.47</B>&#9;He didn’t actually ask for credit, but he was comparing business performance and behaviour with Mr Dorling, who was a trader in silver street, and he said do you allow your customers credit? And Mr Dorling said nobody gets credit in South Cerney, not the Cripps, the Fentons nor anybody who lives in Station Road, it’s cash for purchases, what’s good enough for Barbara Hutton at Woolworths is good enough for Dorlings in South Cerney.  I’m also reminded of another story, and I’m pretty sure this was Mr Dorling, who had a mother and small child come into the shop and there was a pyramid of baked bean tins, and the small child pulled away one of the bottom tins, causing them all to come cascading down, and Mr Dorling, was not upset by that at all, he went to the till opened it up, took out half a crown as it was in those days, and gave it to the small boy and said go up to the Broadway Stores and do the same up there.  On the subject of credit, I also had a conversation with a Colonel Wheeler who used to hire out JCBs at the top of Fossebridge Hill, and he said to me, and I believe it to be quite true, if you put a ferret into any Cotswold village you could flush out at least 3 old Etonians who owed money to their tailor, and that has been my experience too, maybe four old Etonians.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 53.55&#9;</B>…….(?) pre-war and that sort of thing?</P>
<B><P>A 53.56&#9;</B>Well I think what was acceptable in pre-war times would no longer be acceptable now, but even fairly modest houses in Berkeley Road had servants’ quarters, not necessarily a green baize door, but there was that feel to it, and the kitchen was intended for the cook to sit in, and be in, and there was an invisible, almost visible division between the staff quarters and then I’m also reminded at Warrens Gorse, my father saying to Aubrey Price what sort of glass would you like in the windows of the kitchen quarters and that seemed an innocent enough question, but Aubrey Price said I’ll have obscured glass, I’m not having the staff look at me when the meet is held at my house, anyway let them live in a little hell of their own.</P>
<B><P>&#9;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 56.01&#9;</B>Just his duties in running a yard</P>
<B><P>A 56.07&#9;</B>Times change and the people nowadays I don’t think would have tolerated the type of regime there was with the supervisory staff of yesteryear.  Things were pretty well run with a rod of iron.  Like turning up late you lost half and hour straightaway, without the option.  There is so much to say about this particular thing.  Well there are plays based on this sort of thing aren’t there about the north of England and factories and trouble at t’mill and all the rest of it.  And to a very great extent I have a recollection, the things that wake me up at night now, even after 15 years, are the things that went wrong and I dream about it and live through it all, because it was a totally absorbing occupation and it was very difficult to switch off when you got home. When you went to sleep at night you were still wondering where you were going to get a plasterer from to do a job, knowing that there was time limit on it and knowing that people were depending on you it was a very stressful position to be in, to the point where in 1983, I thought enough is enough, if I have to design another cupboard for a blue rinse haired lady, I shall just give up and give up I did, and so that was really the end of the chapter.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Q 58.55</B>&#9;Did you get any gifts from …..?</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A 59.05&#9;</B>Yes, when Ernie Osborne resigned, he had had enough, he said that he would like to give me a desk for my own personal use, so the desk behind me here is the one that he made for me, to my design, but that was what he made, and would not take one penny in wages for the whole time that it took to make it, and it works as beautifully now as it did the day that it was made.</P>
