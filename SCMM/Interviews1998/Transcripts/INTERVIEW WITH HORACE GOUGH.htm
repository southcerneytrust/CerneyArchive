</U><FONT SIZE=2><P>Q 34.30</B>&#9;Why don’t you just tell me about rabbit catching?</P>
<B><P>A 34.35&#9;</B>My father was doing it in the First World War, it wasn’t a war on them it was for the agricultural people, he was catching rabbits and killing them up at Wykeham-Musgraves, that’s where he went to once for them.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 34.59&#9;</B>Did people eat a lot of rabbits in those days?</P>
<B><P>A 35.05&#9;</B>Our rabbits went up to Smithfield Market and Sheffield, all over the place.  We used to go away, there was two or three brothers, two of us especially and in a manner of so of working with dad with us and we used to travel all over the southern half of England.  Down Sudeley Castle Estate, trapped all that down there, but Wiltshire Downs was our best place.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 35.44</B>&#9;Were there any warrens locally in the village?</P>
<B><P>A 35.48&#9;</B>The man next door asked me, they had a flower show up there the other week, he asked me if I would like to go and I thought to myself well I might see one or two I know.  I’ve got a job to get about much.  Do you know I used to ride my bicycle into Ciren once or twice a week until I was 90, then I had these damn shingles and that crippled me right up, I haven’t been on my bike since.  I felt terrible.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 36.26</B>&#9;Were you actually born in South Cerney or Cerney Wick?</P>
<B><P>A  36.29</B>&#9;I was born in South Cerney, do you know where the railway bridge is here, the little bit on the left as you start to go up over the bridge there used to be a little ground and there was a little cottage in there and that’s where I was born.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 36.54</B>&#9;How long have you lived here?</P>
<B><P>A 36.55</B>&#9;In 1986 I think we came here.  Can you remember those on the other side of the road? You remember the red brick house, that’s where we came to live first, there, and then the man built those houses up there for Fairford Air Force, 12 of them, and he wanted to buy my place, because they wouldn’t let him build anymore because my house was right on the side of the road and the cars had to get right out in the road before they could see anything coming this way, so they wouldn’t allow them to build anymore, so he wanted to buy Mr Higgins place up at Bulter’s Court, he had a field up there about three acres or so.  He wanted to buy the house and all the lot and build out in the field.  They wouldn’t allow him to because of mine, so Reg Ives kept coming to me and said I’ll let you have the pick of the houses I build out there if I can take your house down so he can have that to build on.  I said Reg I like room, I hate being fenced in, I like room to move about, because ours went right up to Butler’s Court when we came down here first, about an acre it was.  Anyway he kept coming, and my son and I talked about it and I said all this here with this bungalow is this was all sheds like pig sties and that up here right the whole length, and I said to the wife before she’d been dead now this 32 years and I said to him I’ll tell you what Reg, we used to talk, because when Bradley’s was busy over here going in for gravel and that, you’ve never seen such a dust and mess in your life.  And I said Reg, you build me a house or a bungalow out there where them sheds are and you can pull the house down and do what you like, so that’s how it came about.  So I had this bungalow built, but I broke my ankles and my heels when I was 60 and I thought to myself a bungalow’s better than a house, going upstairs with my feet, because they’re bad now.</P>

<B><P>Q 40.11</B>&#9;Tell me about the old railway station?</P>
<B><P>A 40.21</B>&#9;I learned to ride a bicycle down there.  My father was in with a Mr Griffiths in Cirencester up Gloucester Street, cycle agent, before we came out here.  They came out here, I don’t know exactly but I should think it was the end of the last century, must have because, although all the older boys bar one and me was all born in the village, and he made up an old bicycle with a sack over where the saddle pin was and just an ordinary wheel and we got on on the bridge and ran down the bridge, and that’s how we all learned to ride.  I was 7 or 8 when we done that.</P>

<B><P>Q 41.16</B>&#9;Did any of your family work in the station?</P>
<B><P>A 41.21</B>&#9;No.  None of us worked there.  I can remember when we came down here first I was 7, 1909, when we came here, and I can remember going over to the station, all of us, and seeing the trains go through, with horses, guns and soldiers going down to Southampton for the First World War.  </P>

<B><P>Q 42.00</B>&#9;Did you use the railway a lot?</P>
<B><P>Q42.05</B>&#9;We used to go among all the village, they had a workman’s that used to come from Swindon, a lot of men in the village worked at Swindon Works, and a workman used to come from Swindon into Ciren, to pick up there and back again into Swindon with the workmen, mornings and nights, and we used to use it to go into the pictures when we wanted to go into Ciren.  When we didn’t walk in.  </P>

<B><P>Q 42.40</B>&#9;As a young man what did you do as a trade?</P>
<B><P>A 42.43</B>&#9;Rabbit catching, that was our trade, we used to travel all over the southern half of England, trapping rabbits.  Dad used to go round and see the people, down to Sudeley Castle Estate and places and they would say they thought they had a lot of rabbits there and dad would look round and bid a price for them from September to March and then we went down there and would stop in any old house that was on the farm, you’ve never seen anything like it, talk about hard.  Well, my father, he was brought up hard, he was stone(?)picking when he was a boy, there’s a blacksmith shop at the bottom of Clyffe Pypard  hill, that’s where my father was born.  He used to go out stone(?) picking in the fields then, when he was a young man, when he wanted shooting, him and another boy, a friend of his from school.  They used to have to pay then to go to school then, and he was all for shooting, him and this other boy, they would wander hundreds of miles to get a catapult stick.  He was a dab hand with a catapult stick, anything, and that what he done, he mooched from school and travel round and I think he knew every inch of Westonbirt Estate.  Dad was born at Tetbury, that was dad’s home and mother was at Brokenborough by Malmesbury.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 44.37</B>&#9;I think you had a sister who went to Ireland.</P>
<B><P>Q 44.44</B>&#9;Kit, she was in service in Ireland when I was born and she had to come back and look after mother when I was born, that was my sister Kit.  Of course they’re all gone now, I’m the last of the Mohicans. </P>

<B><P>Q 45.05</B>&#9;What else do you remember about the 1924 war?</P>
<B><P>A 45.11&#9;</B>I should think a dozen or 15 men went from South Cerney.  I had three or four brothers in the First World War, and then Ray the one that was in the Navy, he joined up as boy service in the Navy, and he was in the First World War, and he got rammed by a submarine or something up in Norway, and I think he said he was in the water for an hour or two before they picked him up and he never recovered.  Then he went back in the Second World War as well, for a long time.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 46.03</B>&#9;Do you go to Armistice Day service every year?</P>
<B><P>A 46.17</B>&#9;The church service?  A vicar by the name of Stephens, I believe that’s who it was.  I’m sure Stephens used to be the vicar here.  Edwards College up here that was a gift for retired parsons’ wives.  There’s all ordinary people living there now.  </P>

<B><P>Q 46.56</B>&#9;Did you go to Ann Edwards School?</P>
<B><P>A 47.00</B>&#9;Yes, as I said I was up here with Peggy at Cerney School.  Why it happened I don’t know, but I think  I was a little bit of a weakling out of the lot.  Anyway I went into Cirencester Grammar School for a couple of terms, they had to pay £2. 10s. a term in those days, and why me, I don’t know.  I learned more up at Cerney School up here in one week than I learned at the Grammar School in all three terms.  I loved the school up here; there were four of us, two boys and two girls was in the top class A.</P>
<P>We used to do a bit of gardening one afternoon, they had a good garden up at the old school, and we used to have half a day out there gardening then.</P>





<B><P>Q 48.16&#9;</B>Do you remember the gravel beginning?</P>




<B><P>A 48.22&#9;</B>There was me, my brother Jack, who died when he was 21, Bert Willis and Sid Evans, who used to work for dad catching, we were the first four to start up here at Bradleys, when they came here first.  We dug their gravel with pick and shovel and put it on to little skips and pushed it up to the washer.  And old Mr Bradley, that was these sons father, he used to come down, because these sons weren’t about much then, he used to come down he had a Billy cock(?) hat on and an old piece of bag tied round his mack, that’s just how he was, he looked a proper old tramp when he came down here first.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 49.18&#9;</B>Was he a strict employer?</P>
<B><P>A 49.20&#9;</B>He was very good, there was no better employers in Cerney than Bradleys.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 49.32</B>&#9;Do you think it was good for the village to have the work there?</P>
<B><P>A 49.41</B>&#9;Well it was then, but not all this water, I can remember when all this water was cornfields and grass and all that, and I said if we only thought of it, when Bradleys came here first to take the gravel out, if we had said to him for every yard of gravel you take out you put a penny towards the village, look what that would have mounted up to.  We worked up there for nearly all the time.</P>

<B><P>Q 50.35</B>&#9;Did you play a lot in the woods and fields when you were young?</P>
<B><P>A 50.44&#9;</B>Oh yes we could get about a lot, go down to Wilmer and then go down the stream fishing, up the canal catching fish there.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 51.02&#9;</B>Tell me about old Tom Griffiths and his son</P>
<B><P>A 51.07&#9;</B>Tom yes, I remember the old man used to<B> </B>be coal merchant in the village, he used to go round with a horse and cart in the village Tom did, and I don’t know, let me think, when he was about there was a murder on and I remember I was down the place there talking to them and old man Tom came out and shouted out to his wife Het, Het, that bally Armstrong’s been sentenced .  He never swore, it was always bally.</P>
<B>
<P>A 52.15</B>&#9;Station Road when we came, there was just enough room for a horse and cart, because there were no cars then.  They used to come down here for haymaking and take hay off that’s all there was, just room for that.  Broadway Lane was just the same as this, just a little lane with grass in the middle. </P>

<B><P>Q 52.48</B>&#9;What was the main way of getting out of the village to join the Roman road as it were?</P>
<B><P>A52.52</B>&#9;The only way was on a bicycle then, there were some buses, a man by the name of Huxley used to have buses here, and he used to run a bus into Ciren once or twice a week and take people in.</P>

<B><P>Q 53.13</B>&#9;Do you remember the lemonade factory?</P>
<B><P>A 53.15</B>&#9;Yes.  I know it well, I think some people now have got one of the bottles.  Johnsons and the Goughs I think were the first two big families to come into the village.  Johnsons came into the village post office, they took over then.  I think them and us were the first ones to come into the village.  </P>

<B><P>Q 53.55</B>&#9;How did the milk get delivered in those days?</P>
<B><P>A 54.02</B>&#9;They used to come up from Wick, Reg Smith a farmer there, a pony and float and a churn and a couple of buckets and he used to come up here with his horse and go round the village with the milk, because I used to get on with him and go round the village with him until school time.  You dipped it in the bucket and put it in your jug or whatever you had.</P>

<B><P>Q 54.37</B>&#9;Did anybody have any oxen for ploughing?</P>
<B><P>A 54.42</B>&#9;Bathurst had them up there, I think they’re up there now.  It was all horses then, there were no cars, horses used to come down here, and the people bringing the cows down to feed in the meadows.</P>

<B><P>Q 55.18</B>&#9;Can you remember the boats on the canal and the boat people?</P>
<B><P>A 55.25</B>&#9;There was nobody like that there that I can remember, because I can remember once just faintly when Hicks used to keep the shop, the father Sid, the daughter still lives up by the police station now. I can remember Sid once, when the canal froze, went up there skating and they used to go from Tucks all down the canal, but I’ve never seen it since, we don’t get the winters like we used to get.</P>

<B><P>Q 56.16</B>&#9;Do you remember the flooding in the High Street?</P>
<B><P>A 56.22</B>&#9;The stream that comes by the flood hatches here, runs on top just up here about 200 yards up and that flooded once and that came all down the fields and there used to be a ditch, my vegetable garden, the bottom half was flooded and got inside, it came through the shed and I had to put everything up on boxes, it went out round up to the back door of the house all the way round and out the front, yet it never went in the house.</P>
</FONT><B><P>&#9;</P>




<FONT SIZE=2><P>Q 57.19</B>&#9;&#9;Can you tell me anything about flooding the fields  in the winter?  </P>




<B><P>A 57.25</B>&#9;Yes, all the beautiful meadows.  Jack Seams and two or three of them used to come down with breast ploughs(?) and plough all the ditches out and used to flood them to have grass and there was some grass there, beautiful meadows and hundreds and hundreds of different grass flowers, nothing there now.  All the grass and even the birds have gone.  Farming you know that’s what killed them all that’s what done it.  All this artificial and poison on the ground, nothing but greed.  </P>

<B><P>Q 58.13</B>&#9;Did you go birds’ nesting as a boy?</P>
<B><P>A 58.17</B>&#9;You daren’t talk about now, leave alone go.  I used to have great boxfuls of them.</P>

<B><P>Q 58.30</B>&#9;Do you like watching them?</P>
<B><P>A 58.35</B>&#9;I feed the birds out her now, chaffinches, bullfinches and sparrows all sorts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 58.50</B>&#9;What were the amusements in the evening, did you go to the pub much?</P>
<B><P>A 58.54</B>&#9;There was very little here in the evenings.  We used to have people who travelled round with a horse and they used to come out in the fields and put up a stage and sing.  We used to have that when we were kids.</P>

<B><P>Q 59.28</B>&#9;Do you remember the mummers’ play when you were a boy?</P>
<B><P>A 59.39</B>&#9;My brother Harry and Trump Taylor they were in the mummers and they used to go round the village mummering on Christmas night.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>A 00.00</B>&#9;They don’t know when they are well off these days, I’ve worked hard all my life and I’ve played hard, and I’ve enjoyed every minute of it.</P>

<B><P>Q 00.19</B>&#9;Do you still work a bit?</P>
<B><P>A 00.23</B>&#9;I’ve got a garden out there 20 yards square, a vegetable garden,  I don’t do all of it though, because my neighbour is very good, he does a lot of the digging.  But I dig a lot of it and I plant it all, I’ve got enough potatoes out there that I’ve dug this year to last until March.  I’ve got purple sprouting and sprouts and everything out there.   One or two of the men up in the village here, I frighten them when I say.  They say you want to give up that damn gardening they said at your age, I said you’d be a damn sight better if you done a bit.  If I had to give up work now that would finish me.  The will’s good now, I don’t feel 60 in myself, I feel as healthy as can be, my only trouble is my feet, and my eyes.  I had a cataract in my eyes and I went to the optician at Cricklade and he said  about this cataract and I went down to Cheltenham and had it taken away, and I had to go down a second time, two doctors looked at my eyes, and they looked at me and said well Mr Gough  we can’t see anything wrong with your eyes, it’s not your eyes, it’s your age.  I said why don’t you just say I’m an old man and be done with it.  </P>

<B><P>Q 02.30</B>&#9;Are you looking forward to being 100?</P>
<B><P>A 02.38</B>&#9;Time will tell.  As long as I’m no worry to anyone I don’t care how long I live.  But I do all the housework, cooking, ironing, washing.  The boy takes his washing into the launderette and he takes his sheets, because I haven’t got a washing machine.  </P>

<B><P>Q 03.16</B>&#9;You must have known a lot of changes in wages too?</P>
<B><P>A 03.21</B>&#9;When we were working for my father, rabbit catching, we used to go away on a Monday morning, stay away all the week until Friday, and if sometimes if we earned half a crown, we thought we were millionaires. </P>

<B><P>Q 03.46&#9;</B>How much was a pint of beer then?</P>
<B><P>A 03.49</B>&#9;I never went up to the pubs in the village, I should think it was about a penny or 2d. </P>

<B><P>Q 04.14</B>&#9;You were saying as we came in the house that Peggy Fenton was at school with you?</P>
<B><P>A 04.20</B>&#9;Yes she was, Peggy was up at the school when I was there.  </P>

<B><P>Q 04.34</B>&#9;Do you remember Miss Grace Haddow?</P>
<B><P>A 04.35</B>&#9;Yes course I do.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 04.36</B>&#9;Would you like to tell us something about her?</P>
<B><P>A 04.39</B>&#9;You’re going back a bit too far now, but I remember her, but I don’t know a lot about her because she was an old woman when I was young.  I remember nearly all the people who lived at Edwards College.</P>





<B><P>Q 05.07</B>&#9;Tell us about some of them that you remember</P>




<B><P>A 05.10</B>&#9;Goodwins. Mrs Goodwin, she was a widow when she came here and her daughter.  Chadwicks.  Miss Hall, nice person she had St Vitus’ Dance didn’t she?  </P>

<B><P>Q 05.45</B>&#9;You don’t own any of her pictures?</P>
<B><P>A 05.52</B>&#9;No.  As far as photography or anything like that went, I never had any interest in it.  </P>
<B>
</FONT><P>Q 06.07</B>&#9;Did you like songs?</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>A 06.09&#9;</B>Yes.  I’ve said, when they’ve had these damn screaming women on the television, because that’s all it is screaming and squawking, I said why the hell don’t you put a decent song on. We got to pay £100 a year for the television as well as they.  You seldom get a good song now on there.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 06.38</B>&#9;Do you remember James Mills in the village? Or Charles Messenger down at Cerney Wick?</P>
<B><P>A 07.04</B>&#9;I remember the Smiths and all them down at Cerney Wick when were kids at school, because Sid Smith, one of the sons, he was my age, he used to walk up from Cerney Wick everyday to go to school.  One woman, a widow, used to live up here in a bungalow and her husband worked at Bradleys, she got a daughter and a son.  The son, they thought he was going in the navy, but he went over to Cricklade to work in the garage.  When he went over, he was going to get £5 per hour, and he said I’m not going to work for £5 per hour.  We used to have to work for more than a week to earn that.  That would have been about £150 a week for a 7-hour day.  What I used to like at school was history and arithmetic.  I can add up now in my head quicker than a lot of folk.  I remember going into Woolworths once or twice, when they came here first, the girls behind the counter used to have a piece of paper to add up if you bought 4 or 5 little things, and I used to that’s so and so; I could work it out in my head in no time, I was good at arithmetic.  That and history, I liked history, the First World War and the Boer War, I liked all that.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 09.17</B>&#9;Was any of your family in the Boer War?</P>
<B><P>A 09.22&#9;</B>No they weren’t old enough for the Boer War.  Two of them went as boy service, in the Army and the Navy in the First World War, they were only about 14 or 15 then.  Two of my brothers were only 16 when they were called up for the First World War.  I escaped both of them, I wasn’t old enough for the First World War, and I was too old for the Second.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 10.02</B>&#9;Did you join the Home Guard?</P>
<B><P>A 10.04</B>&#9;No.  I didn’t join that much, because I’ve got to think about the Home Guard, the song.  Mr Brown he works in town and he is 21, he comes home each evening and he’s ready with his gun.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 10.34</B>&#9;Do you watch television much?</P>
<B><P>A 10.36&#9;</B>Yes, but I can’t see it now, I can see the movement, but I can’t discern who’s who, but if they are talking, I say to the boy well put it up a bit louder, because if I can hear the voices I know who it is.  I can see the movement, but I just can’t see the people to know who they are.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 10.59</B>&#9;How do you get your news, do you listen to the news on radio?</P>
<B><P>A 11.04</B>&#9;I listen to the news on the TV, that’s about all you can do, because this stuff that they put on today these pop stars and stuff.  Talking about pop stars and the money that they get.  I’ve only seen it once, there were three men on the stage singing, and there was one man sat in the audience in a chair, I imagine he looked after them.  When they had finished singing this man got up and said You look awful and you can’t sing, but you’ll go a long way.  That’s quite right too.</P>

<B><P>Q 12.39</B>&#9;During your long life, who do you think has done most for the country as a whole?</P>
<B><P>A 12.49</B>&#9;It just depends, a lot of people are good in civilian life and a lot of people were good in war.  You got to go a long way to beat Churchill.</P>

<B><P>Q 13.08</B>&#9;I’ve heard a rumour that he may have been up at the Camp during the War, have you ever heard that story?</P>
<B><P>A 13.14&#9;</B>I can remember when that Camp was beautiful farmland, because we used to go up there always, cutting mangels and swedes when were youngsters, in our teens.  Talking about Churchill, I’ll never forget him when he had that speech never in the history of human warfare have so many owed so much to so few.  That was quite right about the Battle of Britain</FONT>.</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>




<P>Q 14.03</B>&#9;&#9;Do you remember any of the trainee pilots up at the Camp.</P>
<B><P>A 14.07</B>&#9;&#9;I can’t remember. My son knew quite a few of them.</P>

<B><P>Q 14.17</B>&#9;&#9;It’s very historic that they trained so many before the War.</P>




<B><P>A 14.23</B>&#9;Yes there was a training Camp up there.  They had 4 or 5 big hangars up there.</P>

<B><P>Q 14.33</B>&#9;Some of them crashed didn’t they?</P>
<B><P>A 14.35</B>&#9;Yes they did.  I can remember one German war plane in the First World War, he came down the other side of Cirencester, and we went out there to see him.  A German war plane that they fetched down.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 15.29</B>&#9;Do you think children these days like history enough?</P>
<B><P>A 15.36</B>&#9;To tell you the truth, there are no children today.  There was a talk on the television and they said where are the children of today.  When we used to go to school we had an old bicycle frame and a stick in him, the girls used to knit on a cotton reel, horse race, and go up there playing horses to school, skipping and all that we used to do going up to school, but not now they are picked up in buses and taken to school, it makes them lazy.  We were all brought up the hard way, my father was hard as iron, but we thank him for it now</P>
