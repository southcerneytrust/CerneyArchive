<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 09.51&#9;&#9;</B>Did you come originally from South Cerney?</P>

<B><P>A 09.54</B>&#9;No I come from Leicestershire. We first came here 1989, when the pub was much smaller than it is now, we just had one little bar at the front and five rooms.  From 1989 to now, 1998, we have put 14 rooms on, another restaurant, a non-smoking restaurant which is very popular; when our restaurants are booked that is always the first one to be booked, and two suites for families, which was the old butcher’s shop, which is the property next door, which we bought four years ago, and added on to the pub, and the other one was a flat on the old barn at the back of the building, which they say is one of the oldest buildings in South Cerney, is another suite that we had as pour flat about two years after we came here.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 10.46</B>&#9;Why did you choose to come to South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 10.48</B>&#9;This is not my profession, I am a Quantity Surveyor, and I’ve spent quite a lot of my time leaning against pub bars, so we took a pub in Leicestershire for a small brewery, we didn’t own that, it was a small brewery called Home Ales from Nottingham, and they were taken over by Scottish and Newcastle and the rent that we paid went through the roof, so we made the decision to look for somewhere, and we were going to Torquay, and the night before we were going to look at an hotel on the Babbacombe Road, and I looked at the Exchange and Mart in the Bath and then this place ,16<SUP>th</SUP> Century inn in the Cotswolds by a stream, it was in the Exchange and Mart, so I said Linda, we’ll have a look at that on the way down, and we came and stopped here and we liked it so much that we made an offer and the rest as they say, is history.</P>

<B><P>Q 11.44</B>&#9;How do the people is South Cerney strike you?</P>
<B><P>A 11.48</B>&#9;Very nice, very pleasant, very laid back.  In Leicestershire nobody has got a minute for anything it’s grab grab grab.  They are very pleasant, as long as you don’t come here and say well I’m going to do this, I’m going to do that, it’s their village and you are coming into it and for quite a long while you’ve got to, you know they are very pleasant people.</P>

<B><P>Q 12.28</B>&#9;Has the turnover increased?</P>
<B><P>A 12.38</B>&#9;The turnover over since we’ve been here in the last 9 years has become way beyond our greatest expectations.  A pub is not a semi-retirement thing anymore, they’re like everything else, it is big business and it is, we have got the locals here, which is a very big part of our business, but because we have got the hotel as well we’ve got commercial trade and of course the Cotswolds is a great holiday area, and the importance of the Water Park, all these things add to it and it has increased dramatically the turnover since we’ve been here.  The village has altered out of all recognition since we’ve been here.</P>

<B><P>Q 13.25</B>&#9;What proportion of your customers are coming from the Water Park, are they going there for recreation or fishing?  </P>
<B><P>A 13.32</B>&#9;I think one of the biggest draws to this part of the Cotswolds is definitely the water and the sports that go with the water, most definitely I think we get a lot of people from the south east and Wales, surprising the number of people from Wales, but the Water Park and the water and water based activities is a lot to do with the visitors.</P>

<B><P>Q 14.00</B>&#9;Do you think the rates will go up because of this?</P>
<B><P>A 14.04</B>&#9;I think the rates are very high now and we pay astronomical rates for this place and get absolutely nothing.  We get the hospitals and roads like everybody else, but they don’t even empty a bin for us that’s extra and I’m not complaining, because while the business is good that’s not a problem, but I know one or two people who do struggle with it and I suppose it is going to be extra rates for people coming in, Devon and Cornwall have suffered with it for years, and I think they will go up.  But saying that, we have another interest with holiday cottages in the Lake District, and the rates there are nearly twice what they are here, with even less services.  Swings and roundabouts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 15.03</B>&#9;Did you actually buy this place?</P>
<B><P>A 15.05</B>&#9;Yes we did, we bought it in 1989 at 1989 prices, but yes we own it also the bank.  </P>

<B><P>Q 15.14</B>&#9;Do you have a number of foreign visitors?</P>
<B><P>A 15.15</B>&#9;Yes we get a lot of foreign visitors, the world is a smaller place now with the technology, we are on the World Wide Web, and with the fax; you can pick a fax up that has come from a travel agent in Tokyo, or a travel agent in Australia, it is unbelievable.  We get a high proportion of American and Japanese visitors off the advertising we are doing worldwide through the English Tourist Board and the AA.</P>

<B><P>Q 15.47</B>&#9;Have you had any particular reactions from the Japanese?</P>
<B><P>A 15.49</B>&#9;Oh they love it, there are a lot of aspects that we have put in this hotel that are new, that they say how many hundred years has that fireplace been there, that nook been there, and really it’s only been there 5 years.  Yes the love the Cotswolds especially the Americans, because they’ve got no history, only 200 years.  They think of us as the small poorer brother, but they like to come back to the old country I think.  We get a lot of pleasant reaction.</P>

<B><P>Q 16.20</B>&#9;Do you have Americans who have been in this area…………………?</P>
<B><P>A 16.24</B>&#9;We get quite a lot of older visits who were here during the war or after the war, or were stationed at Fairford and all the other American bases that were round here and a lot of ex-RAF people that were at Cerney Camp.  We had one gentleman who was based here during the war, and he came for a number of years.  We do get a lot of people who were here years ago and obviously the whole thing different from what it was then.</P>

<B><P>Q 16.58</B>&#9;inaudible question</P>
<B><P>A 17.02</B>&#9;At the hotel there are six skittle teams in the skittle alley we’ve got at the back, but I’m a bit of a rugby buff, so we get involved with that a bit with Cirencester and argue the boys in here support Gloucester and I support Leicester Tigers.  That’s an on-going argument, which is good, when we first came here rugby was never talked about it was all football but we’ve hopefully got them to see that queer shaped ball is the game to play, but other than that it is fairly difficult, it’s a time consuming business, it’s a hands on business so when we’re here we’re here 24 hours a day, which you’ve got to be, people expect to see you.  We support local things as much as the other people in the village do.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 17.53</B>&#9;There are three pubs in the village, one opposite, how do you all get on?</P>
<B><P>A 17.55</B>&#9;Very well, the last few years the George has gone from an American theme pub back to a quiet village pub, and the other pub in the village, the Royal Oak is very much a village orientated pub, and then there’s the Eliot.  When we first came here the Eliot Arms was just a poor relation, it needed a lot doing to it, and we’ve done quite a lot, a hell of a lot, I think we all complement each other in different ways.  We’re different to the others because we are a free house and it’s an hotel as well, so we probably draw from a wider area, but the George is probably the oldest pub in the village, but the Eliot Arms has some strange quirks, it was owned by Cirencester Brewery by Mr Raymond Fenton’s ancestors and it’s got strange covenants on all the buildings round it what they can and can’t do in favour of the Eliot Arms, they can’t set up selling beer, that is why Mr Dorling’s shop, which is Bridge House now, could not have an off-licence, because of the covenant for many years, when it was sold it could never sell beer. We have got rights of way over various places, which have just come through time.  This is a very old building, I should imagine there has been something here since Roman times because of its close proximity to the river, but I think the pubs round here we all get on very well.</P>

<B><P>Q 19.30</B>&#9;Describe how the butcher’s shop was…………?</P>
<B><P>A 19.34</B>&#9;When we bought the Eliot Arms, it wasn’t as large as it is now.  Looking at it on the right hand side was the butcher’s shop, Mr Bowman’s, and his living accommodation.  In the early 90’s he decided to get out of it so we bought the butcher’s shop and his accommodation and put a restaurant in there and accommodation above where we live, and the actual butcher’s shop now is a separate little suite with a four poster bed and old beams which is right on the river which we let out.  We never tell people that years ago it was the slaughterhouse as well.  I don’t know whether that would go down very well, but I believe in the late 19<SUP>th</SUP> early 20<SUP>th</SUP> Century it was the slaughterhouse.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 20.25</B>&#9;Where did you get all these extraordinary things?</P>
<B><P>A 20.29</B>&#9;The collection that is in the pub is wide and varied; I think I am a collectomaniac and I think my wife is to a lesser degree and it’s just built up over a number of years, and a lot of photographs of interesting sports and people and we’ve just acquired it over the years.  I think it’s a quirk in us but people spend hours looking and this and looking at that, and they say I didn’t notice that.  It’s a collection that has come from our homes and past pubs we’ve had and really it’s a collection of our life.</P>

<B><P>Q 21.12</B>&#9;Are there any old photos of South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 21.15</B>&#9;Yes in the function room there’s a lot of photographs of South Cerney, and in the passage and of the Eliot when in flooded in the 1920’s ands various other bits and bobs. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 21.30</B>&#9;Now you haven’t got any funny stories ……………….?</P>
<B><P>A 21.34</B>&#9;Well there’s one story; a lady and gentleman came to stay here 12 months ago and she said do you take parrots? Can I bring the parrot in, they were stopping here for a couple of days and I said well how big is it.  she said it’s Arthur, it’s not very big, and lo and behold in came Arthur in the cage, he was only a small one but it was a beautiful thing, he was 25.  So we get some strange requests, but I think that was the strangest, can we bring the parrot in?  </P>

<B><P>Q 22.32</B>&#9;How many people do you employ?</P>
<B><P>A 22.53</B>&#9;Approximately 22 people are employed at the Eliot arms in a part time or full time capacity, from the gardener, the chambermaids, the housekeeper, chefs, kitchen porters, bar staff, plus Linda and myself, so I suppose we are a reasonably large employer in the village. </P>
