<P>Tape 13</P>

<B><U><P>&nbsp;</P>
</U><P>Q 00.04&#9;&#9;</B>Could you just say who you are?</P>
<B><P>A 00.08&#9;&#9;</B>Sheila Baker now, but Sheila Stephens obviously.</P>
<B><P>A 0014&#9;</B>&#9;Margaret Dingwall now, Stephens as was.</P>





<B><P>Q 00.20</B>&#9;Together you were brought up in South Cerney, did you go to school at Ann Edwards?</P>
<B><P>A 00.26&#9;</B>Yes, yes.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 00.28</B>&#9;Can you tell me what it was like then?</P>
<B><P>A 00.34 –S&#9;</B>Very small obviously, we seemed to do a lot of outside activities, I think maybe because I enjoyed sport, we seemed to do a lot of playground activity.</P>
<B><P>A 00.52 –M&#9;</B>I actually remember spending more time inside. [<B>S</B> - Lots of sewing a lot of tables). Chanting tables every day at the age of 7, not only the times tables but also weights and measures, the pounds, shillings and pence tables, until you knew them inside out and backwards, upside down and standing on your head.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 01.18</B>&#9;Do you remember the little master and mistress’s cottage behind the school?</P>
<B><P>A 01.25 –M&#9;</B>Yes, but when we were there it was more the stationery store, and the office where mum was in fact, because she was the school secretary as well and her office was there, but it’s the smell of it I remember, the smell of the books and paints and things that were stored there.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 01.47</B>&#9;Was it an attractive old cottage?</P>
<B><P>A 01.50-S&#9;</B>I don’t actually remember, it had a garden I think.  [<B>M</B> – it was fenced off from the school you had to go up a little path behind the infant classroom to collect the registers. [<B>S</B>- you didn’t really notice when you were a child whether it was attractive or not.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 02.10&#9;</B>And you were in the old building? Can you describe the classrooms?</P>
<B><P>A 02.12 –S&#9;</B>Certainly the first classroom you went down the side of the school and turned in at the back and the girls’ cloakrooms were there, then you turned right into classroom, and you went through that one into Miss Cole’s class, where we did a lot of sewing.  I enjoyed that class.  [<B>M –</B>But there was also a front entrance into Miss Cole’s class.  [<B>S</B>- That’s right, then Miss Dunn was right at the far end, and Mr Chambers was in the middle. [<B>M – </B>The dividing wall between Mr Chambers and Miss Cole could actually be pushed to one side.  They were very tall rooms, and very cold in the winter so you huddled round the … [<B>S</B> – I don’t remember the cold.  When we were in the top class we had to go down to the village hall, Mr Peyman’s class was down there, where we also had the school dinners. [<B>M- </B>So half of the hall had the desks in and the other half had the long tables with the benches for lunches.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 03.21</B>&#9;Sheila, what happened to you after you left, when did you leave and where did you go?</P>
<B><P>A 03.28 –S&#9;</B>I went to the grammar school, as we all did and stayed there for the due amount of time and then I went to Oxford, to the Radcliffe Infirmary to nurse.</P>
<B>
<P>Q03.41</B>&#9;When did you get married and where did you meet your husband?</P>
<B><P>A 03.43 –S&#9;</B>I met him in the hospital and we married here in 1968.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 03.51</B>&#9;What does he do for a living?</P>
<B><P>A 03.53 –S&#9;</B>He was a planner, and my present husband is also a planner.</P>
<B>
<P>Q04.05</B>&#9;Did you take part in the flower shows at all?</P>
<B><P>A 04.10 –S&#9;</B>Yes, we all did sewing at school, so we used to put bits of needlework in, handwriting, paintings occasionally, collections of wild flowers, we cooked cakes and things sometimes, but of course our parents were very much involved with the flower show.  They were very big affairs then, much, much bigger than they are now, a lot of work went into them, they were held in the field at Upper-up. [<B>M –</B> Because it wasn’t just a flower show, there were sports events, athletics events, in the first part of the afternoon, followed by a gymkhana and the end of the afternoon.  The 70-mile cycle race came later.  But of course there was always a big procession as well, which we were in many times. [<B>S – </B>When we were little children we were sweet peas and sailors.</P>
<B>




<P>Q 05.30&#9;&#9;</B>Were either of you every Carnival Queen?</P>




<B><P>A 05.32 -M</B>&#9;We both were, all three were, Anne was as well, in fact I think Anne was the very first Carnival Queen.  But that year for the flower show, they also had a competition for householders to decorate their homes, and I remember dad decorating our house as a castle, complete with flag and bunting, but it poured with rain that day.  I think perhaps after that year they decided they would insure against rain for the flower shows.</P>
<B>
<P>Q06.17</B>&#9;When do you think it shrank to the village hall?</P>
<B><P>A06.25 -M&#9;</B>Certainly after we left the village.  Lost the procession, first then the athletics.  I know dad was always miffed that the prizes for the horticultural show were always, shall we say rather modest, but the prizes for the athletics, although they weren’t monetary prizes, they were what he would have called decent prizes, it was all amateur, so they weren’t allowed to accept money, but it was things like clocks and rose bowls, and even down to third and forth people would get a decent prize, and yet for the first prize for one of the classes in the horticultural tent were 2/6d or something.</P>

<B><P>Q 07.18&#9;</B>What do you remember about your father’s wartime experiences, that me may have told you about?</P>
<B><P>A 07.23 –S&#9;</B>Not a lot when we were children, he talked very little about it in fact.  We knew he had the boson’s whistle and he used to talk about depth charges, but he was a fairly busy person and didn’t talk all that much about naval life when we were small.  They were very involved in flowers and gardening and work of course and I think perhaps it didn’t really become a strong interest for him until we all disappeared and he had more time on his hands and then he began to think again about the people he served with and when the Flag [?) Corvette Association came into being.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 08.15</B>&#9;Did he have a warm response to his film when it appeared on television?</P>
<B><P>A 08.24 –S&#9;</B>Which<B> </B>film do you mean, The Call of the Sea?  I think his response came really from advertising in the Navy News and the local newspaper and local radio and it grew gradually from that.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 08.51</B>&#9;It’s a very important part of Navy history, going to be lost was it?</P>
<B><P>A 09.14 –S</B>&#9;Now yes, initially he started it as a way of finding people that he served with and then putting others in touch with their own shipmates, that’s how it began and that was always a very important part to him, that people could contact people they hadn’t seen for 40 years, and then he began to have requests for information about perhaps where a ship went down. There’s a lady I know in Sussex who asked my father to find out where her brother went down, and it was things like that he was very interested in, and the rest kind of grew I think.  But of course a lot of information was then sent to him and when people asked for information themselves, he had it at his fingertips.  Then there was the exhibition in Portsmouth and he gave them a lot of information and other people contributed too.</P>

<B><P>Q 10.21</B>&#9;Where was it in Portsmouth?</P>
<B><P>A 10.22 –S</B>&#9;In the Royal Naval Museum.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 10.24</B>&#9;Can you define what a corvette is, because I don’t know?</P>
<B><P>A 10.28 –S&#9;</B>A very small ship.  An escort ship for convoys going across the Atlantic mainly.  I don’t know how big it was, it probably had 70 or 80 people on it and therefore they were a close-knit community.  It was very uncomfortable by all accounts, very wet, pretty miserable and very dangerous too.</P>
<B>




<P>Q 11.00&#9;&#9;</B>Was he ever sunk in his ship?</P>
<B><P>A 11.02 –S</B>&#9;No. But the Orchis was sunk after he left it, off the coast of France.</P>

<B><P>Q 11.20</B>&#9;&#9;What about the D-Day landings?</P>
<B><P>A 11.24 –S</B>&#9;I don’t know those details.</P>

<B><P>Q11.34&#9;&#9;</B>Tell me what did he actually do as a civilian?</P>




<B><P>A 12.05  -S&#9;</B>A painter and decorator. Many of the houses around have the marks of Mr Stephens on them.</P>

<B><P>Q 12.16</B>&#9;Did you live at the College? </P>
<B><P>A 12.17 –S</B>&#9;Yes we did</P>
<B>
<P>Q 12.19</B>&#9;At what stage?</P>
<B><P>A 12.25 -M</B>&#9;Number 5, I don’t know if I was born there, but Martin was born there certainly. [<B>S</B> – So when we were quite small for a short period, then we went to 1 Broadway Lane, which we shared with an old lady and her daughter, and they had one bedroom and one living room, and we had 2 bedrooms and 1 living room and joint use of the kitchen.</P>

<B><P>Q 12.56</B>&#9;That was due to wartime lack of housing?</P>
<B><P>A 12.59 –S</B>&#9;No I don’t think so, we didn’t have much money I guess, we were quite a big family there were four of us.  I don’t really know the reason, we couldn’t stay with granny any longer I think because it as a bit much for Granny.  Then we went to live down between the brooks, Bow Wow, half of South Cerney House Cottages, now known as Lower Churn.</P>

<B><P>Q 14.55</B>&#9;Where did you play when you were small?</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A 15.00 –S</B>&#9;When we were very little, at the College, we played in the field opposite. When we were in Broadway Lane, we played in the street, in our back garden, where we did shows, [<B>M</B> - and in the field behind where Berkeley Close is now, that was just a big open space, with a horse in it, and a very stagnant pond with lots of newts.  [<B>S – </B>And the washers of course) [<B>M – </B>where Oak Way is now, and the Withies, where Sudeley Drive is now, and the Meadows.  We went through the Meadows to go to school when we lived in Broadway Lane. [<B>S</B> – When we lived down Bow Wow we played everywhere, in the river, under the railway bridge in the fields up the trees, and I think we were probably freer in those days. [<B>M –</B> But even when we were living down Broadway Lane, we would wander off and follow the river along to Siddington very often.  [<B>S – </B>I think Gypsy Lane was the only place we didn’t go, it was scary.  [<B>M –</B> And when we lived between the brooks we used to go for long walks along the canal, as far as to where the Spine Road is now.  [<B>S</B> – you were allowed to pick cowslips in those days, and mushrooms and blackberries. [<B>M</B> - and white violets if you knew where to find them.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Q 17.00</B>&#9;Did you belong to the guides? Any stories about that?</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A 17.03</B>&#9;Yes Brownies and Guides. [<B>M – </B>The tips out to the island, in the gravel pits, here we would be met by Big Chief – Captain Fenton – Big Chief.  Jungle juice we had to drink.  We used to go quite far afield camping, but because our captain, Beryl Whiteman wasn’t actually certified for taking camps we used to go with North Cerney Guides with a Miss Tetley. [<B>S</B> – I think camping was different then, I think things like le latts were, I don’t think you have latts now do you?  You go to a campsite with proper facilities.  [M – We used to go on Brownie pack holidays as well didn’t we, Bishopstone, I remember one we went to.  And our Auntie Millie, Millie Gassor often used to come along as Quartermaster for the camps and the Brownie pack holidays.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Q 18.59</B>&#9;Margaret, what did you do when you left school?</P>
<B><P>A 19.00 –M&#9;</B>After Grammar School I went to Cardiff University where I took a degree in Maths, and I did a teacher training year, spend two years teaching at a Comprehensive school in Cardiff and then moved to another comprehensive in Hertfordshire.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 19.34</B>&#9;How did a comprehensive seem after Ann Edwards?</P>
<B><P>A 19.38 –M&#9;</B>Big, the first school I went to, although it was all on one site, it was in 3 separate buildings, and one that basically has the maths and science and most of the upper school taught there and the lower school were in another building, and also being in Cardiff we had a very big intake of children for whom English was in fact a second language, so it was very, very different, particularly from the Grammar school that we had attended.  Quite a rough area, quite an eye opener.</P>
<B>




<P>Q 20.28</B>&#9;&#9;Have you been to the new Ann Edwards?</P>




<B><P>A 20.31 -M&#9;</B>Not for a fair number of years.  The atmosphere’s not the same.  I suppose it’s nostalgia to a certain extent, you always have fonder memories of things that you were involved with, obviously it’s much more modern, it’s much more comfortable.  I don’t know what sort of turnover of staff they’ve had there, but the staff when we were at school were very constant.  I remember a change in the infant teacher, I started off with a Mrs. Liversidge, my second teacher in the infants was Mrs Stephens, but the rest of the teachers, they were just always there.  You felt as if they had been there since time immemorial.</P>





<B><P>Q 21.36</B> &#9;&#9;Were they very strict?</P>




<B><P>A 21.39 –M</B>&#9;Miss Dunn was very strict.  Mr Peyman flexed his cane now and again he would get it out of the cupboard, but as far as I’m aware never had cause to use it, but I think that’s the difference between schools now and schools then, you automatically respected your teachers and took notice of what they said, which I’m afraid is not always the case these days. </P>
<B>
<P>Q  22.13</B>&#9;Do you think that’s a loss too?</P>
<B><P>A 22.17 – M</B>&#9;Yes, I do, teachers don’t have the same standing in the community as they did years ago.  Certainly the headmaster here was always a very respected figure, whereas the head of the school now is just another member of the school but no-one really special, whereas then, particularly in a village the headmaster was certainly very much respected.</P>
<B>
<P>Q22.49</B>&#9;How does South Cerney strike you, coming back here after being in a very different…?</P>
<B><P>A 23.02 –M</B>&#9;We see a lot of changes don’t we, but there are always constants.  [<B>S</B> – The area we tend to come to of course near our parents’ house is the constant bit, so unless we really trek out into the rest of the village, we don’t necessarily see it all coming from the Spine Road.  [<B>M -</B> The amount of building that has gone on since we left, and the change in commercial use of a lot of the buildings, there are more shops, but perhaps a different type.</P>
<B><P>&#9;</B>Miss Lane’s sweet shop was wonderful, but there was another one by the Memorial Cross, I can’t remember what it was called. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 24.14</B>&#9;Could you buy things like knitting wool and cottons?</P>
<B><P>A 24.18 –S</B>&#9;I don’t know what the old Co-op sold initially, I know they sold groceries.</P>
<P>&#9;Sheila Luker had a shop, but I don’t know what that one was. [<B>M</B> – When the one first opened in Broadway Lane, that had all sorts of odd little things in it didn’t it?  [<B>S</B>- I suppose a lot of shops were a mix in a small place.</P>

<B><P>Q 25.05</B>&#9;Did you go a lot into the cinema in Ciren?</P>
<B><P>A 25.08 - M&#9;</B>It was difficult because of the buses, our parents didn’t drive.  [<B>S</B> – We went to Saturday morning pictures though and that was wonderful, absolutely wonderful, I loved that.  In on the 9 o’clock bus, the ABC that was very good.  <B>[M</B> – and a packet of salted peanuts from Woolworth’s, while we waited for the bus home.  [<B>S</B> – And a big film and a cartoon and a little extra bit I suppose.  I don’t know whether they had news, but it was great fun absolutely packed I don’t know how they coped with all those children, but it was wonderful.  [<B>M</B> – But going to the cinema at other times was very difficult because of the times of the buses, the last bus back from Cirencester was just before 10 o’clock, and if you missed that there was nothing else. [<B>S </B>We didn’t go into Cirencester very much at<B> </B>night; we went because we danced and we were in pantomimes, but we didn’t really visit Cirencester in the evenings very much, unless we were with our parents.  They used to get busloads to go up to Swindon to the Operatic Society, shows and things like that which were wonderful, but we didn’t venture out by ourselves very much. [<B>M –</B> It probably was lack of transport to a certain extent.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 26.38</B>&#9;What about during the war, the village dances, meeting chaps and things?</P>
<B><P>A 26.42 –M</B>&#9;We don’t know during the war.  After the war the British Legion used to run socials that we used to go to. [<B>S</B> – they were very good, just a gramophone and some records, but we would dance all night with Auntie Millie and stagger home with blisters, but that was splendid fun. I enjoyed those.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 27.02</B>&#9;What about theatricals ?</P>
<B><P>A 27.14 –S&#9;</B>Mum and dad were very involved with plays, I didn’t do any acting, but I danced, did ballet and so on in the local pantomime in Cirencester and Margaret did as well. [<B>M –</B> I did one play with the Players here, but mum and dad were involved since the beginning.  [<B>S</B> – and mum has been involved with many, many societies, always kind of backroom treasurer, but has been involved with many things.  [<B>M</B> – and if there was a fete going on anywhere, or a jumble sale she was always there at the end to count the money. [<B>S</B> – and she was also very involved with the Welfare, </P>
<P>&#9;you know, when they used to have the Welfare in the village hall, and the nurse and the doctor would come and weigh the children mum would be there to share out the orange juice, and granny as well. [<B>M</B> – and the cod liver oil and the national dried milk. <B>[S</B> – The British Legion also used to have a lot of whist drives didn’t they; we weren’t involved with those, because we didn’t play cards, except with granny.  [<B>M</B> – although the only whist drive I ever remember is the one that they used to have to raise funds for the school Christmas parties, which was a tremendous affair, they also had a grad raffle as well, but the prizes were endless from quite small prizes right up to chickens and ducks and turkeys.  [<B>S</B> – the stage used to be full of  dead poultry. [<B>M</B> – As whist prizes and raffle prizes and then all the money was used to give the children at school a party with a visit from Father Christmas and a present for every child, and an orange and apple to take home at the end of the party.</P>

<B><P>Q 29.31</B>&#9;Do you think people were more contented then?</P>
<B><P>A 29.36  -S&#9;</B>That’s difficult.  I guess people’s expectations were less, they didn’t have televisions, and what you don’t see, you don’t want I guess, maybe that was it.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 30.05</B>&#9;……..(?) put the blame on television?</P>
<B><P>A  30.08  -M&#9;</B>Well our parents refused to have a television initially didn’t they?  It would interfere with our homework.  [<B>S</B> – They certainly didn’t have one until my children were little. [<B>M</B> – They had one shortly after they moved into Orchis, and old black and white.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 30.45</B>&#9;Margaret, I haven’t asked you what happened, how you met your husband?</P>
<B><P>A 30.47&#9;</B>At a party, which was organised by a colleague at from the school I was teaching at in Baldock, on Firework Night.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 31.05</B>&#9;Was he a teacher too?</P>
<B><P>A 31.07</B>&#9;No he’s not.  At the time he was working for a British subsidiary of a German firm which dealt with steam control equipment, but now he works as a contractor in the computer industry, which is quite a change, but he seems to enjoy it.  We were also married here in 1979.  I was allowed to come back even though I had officially left the village for quite a while, I was allowed to come back and leave a suitcase in the hall, then claim residency.</P>

<B><P>Q 31.51</B>&#9;So you regard South Cerney as home?</P>
<B><P>A 31.54 M/S</B>&#9;Oh very much [<B>M</B> both my children were christened here as well.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 33.06</B>&#9;Inaudible question</P>
<B><P>A 33.08 – M&#9;</B>Shortly after they pulled down the little cottage behind the school, a swimming pool was installed, it was a sunken swimming pool, it was actually above the ground, so the children could use it for swimming lessons in the summer.  There was a terrapin in the playground, but I think they put another terrapin on the back, but certainly there was a swimming pool there as well.  They called it a swimming pool.</P>
<P>It was Auntie Millie that actually took us to choir wasn’t it? one by one, as soon as we were old enough to read the words in the hymn book.  But it is choir outings I remember as much as anything.  You always sat in the back, I always sat in the front because I was travel sick , and we used to sing all sorts of interesting songs.  [<B>S</B> – I remember when we went to the seaside when we were little, you always used to go in your best dress and you always froze and got terribly muddy, and then we had tea we always used to have ham salad for tea, then stopped for fish and chips on the way home, but I actually didn’t like the sea very much until I went to Newcastle where the coast is very cold, and after having always gone to the seaside in summer clothes and frozen to death here when I was a child, when I went to the North East I was told to wrap up well and I enjoyed the sea a lot better then than when I was little.  We used to go to Weymouth sometimes actually on holiday.  [<B>M</B> – But Weston-Super-Mare we often used to go to for outings, because it was one of the most accessible, and if you were lucky you caught the tide in.  [<B>S</B> – But I enjoyed the singing too, I did enjoy singing anyway,[<B>M</B> - that was when I started singing contralto, when I was in the church choir.  One Christmas, carol singing.  [<B>S</B> – Now carol singing, that was probably the best bit of being in the choir, over two nights, going round the village, starting at the tree with the lights on and going into the big houses and having mince pies, I enjoyed that very much.  I liked Christmas, and actually Christmas in connection with the church rather than Christmas at home.  Mum and dad didn’t really make a great deal of fuss of festivities and the church did of course, and I enjoyed Christmas because of that, because of the choir and the church.  Carol singing was very good, because you were out late that was good too.  One thing that I must mention, when we were young, we used to go to sewing class, I don’t know if anyone else has mentioned this, Miss Hall used to live in 7 The College, she used to have a sewing class and we all used to go down there and stitch and hem [<B>M</B>- We used to particularly hem tea towels. [<B>S</B> – Aprons we made, didn’t we? And then she would have a sale of work, [<B>M</B>- which was in aid of SPCK, Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge.  [<B>S</B> – And I suppose that was also one of our main activities.  You didn’t have a great number of activities, but that was one thing we all did.  Winter evenings [<B>M</B>- round the fire. [<B>S</B> – Well, round a table.  [<B>M</B> – With the big shutters closed against the elements.  [<B>S</B> – And Mrs Calendar from 1 The College, would come up and supervise, I think she was quite fierce.  Mrs Harris from the Limes used to come too, because we often had sales in her garden.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 38.45</B>&#9;Do you remember any other odd things that used to happen around the College?</P>
<B><P>A 38.47 –S</B>&#9;Round the College?  Oh, we always had our sports day there, the school sports day was always in that field, with the lovely big oak in the middle that’s always been there, and the hollow tree that we used to hide in.  [<B>M</B> and the train, I remember as well.   [<B>S</B> – We actually went to school on the train, to the grammar school – I did, because there was a bus strike.  Certainly when we lived down between the brooks, we used to rush up on to the railway bridge and watch the trains go underneath.  [<B>M</B> – And the top class from the school always had a summer outing to London, and they used to leave from Cerney Station.  We’d go to somewhere like the Science Museum.  It was always exciting going on the train all the way to London.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 39.45</B>&#9;How long did it take, can you remember?</P>
<B><P>A 39.50 –M</B>&#9;No I don’t remember at all, I only remember the tunnels.&#9;</P>
<B>
<P>Q 40.29&#9;</B>Who are we talking about?</P>
<B><P>A 40.31 – M&#9;</B>Miss Barrett, Meg Barrett, she lived down the College, but I’m not sure which number, but she talked a great deal, and if she started talking to you, you just couldn’t get away, and people have been known, if they saw her in the street to actually cross to the other side of the road so they wouldn’t get caught. [<B>S</B> – She had a particular way of walking, when she was talking to you, sort of walking around you and swaying from side to side.  [<B>M </B>– and she used to occasionally go to the cinema in Cirencester, and apparently make comments all the way through the film, about the action that was going on, that it was terrible bad, or they shouldn’t be doing that.  [<B>S</B> – We were also talking about Herbert Stark, who used to go round on his bicycle with just about everything hanging off him, union jacks, vegetables. I don’t know whether he had pots and pans as well, but he was quite a character. [<B>M</B> – But he was one who always entered the decorated bicycle class in the Flower Show, everything used to go on his bicycle for that.  He lived right out of the village, didn’t he? [<B>S</B> – Up on a hill somewhere in a hut, I always thought, maybe I’ve got that wrong. [<B>M </B>– He used to call at the house sometimes to bring dad, I don’t know what he used to bring for dad, but he used to bring something round.</P>

<P>Q 42.21&#9;&#9;</B>Mrs Waddington-Jones?</P>




<B><P>A 42.22 - M</B>&#9;But she moved into number 5 after we moved out didn’t she.  She moved to number 7 later I think, because Miss Hall was there for a very long time. [<B>S</B>-We had a grass skirt in the house for a long time and I’m sure it came from her. [<B>M</B> – I remember the grass skirt, I don’t remember where it came from.  And there was Mrs Lister at number 8, when I was doing French at school, she said she would have French conversation with me on a Saturday morning and I used to go down and help her polish all her brass door knobs and do the dusting and we would sit down and have a glass of home-made lemonade and talk in French.  My French wasn’t very good.  And she had a car parked in the garage at mum and dad’s.  Wasn’t Miss Peach at school at one time? [<B>S</B> – We had a Miss Peach, but I don’t know if it was the same one.  It’s strange, I remember the people up to our house, better than I remember the people past our house.  [<B>M</B> – The only reason I remember Mrs Lister is because I used to go down there on Saturday morning, but beyond that, I don’t think I ever knew who lived in number 12.  [<B>S</B> – I remember the snow against the wall in that field on my birthday, my birthday’s in May, and remember we had snow, it must have been in May, because I remember my party and there was still snow in the field.   [<B>M</B> – She (Mrs Fenton) was quite strict.  The collars that we wore on our gowns always had to be washed and re-starched for Christmas and Easter and think probably Harvest Festival as well.  [<B>S</B>- She hadn’t a great voice herself, but she managed to get the best out of everybody else, but she was very strict.  [<B>M</B> – I, in fact, remember her more as Brown Owl, rather than the choir mistress.  [<B>S</B> – Dressing in the dark, I remember about Brownies, it used to scare me to death.  There was a game that we had to play, where you would take of yours shoes, and your belt, your tie and your hat, I guess, and you all lay down and had your bits beside you in the dark, and then it was like a fire and you had to dress in the dark and have everything on properly.  I think you even had to fold your tie in the dark, that terrified me always, I put it so carefully beside myself, so I could reach it easily and put it on, but I hated that game.  I suppose it taught us something.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 46.02&#9;</B>Did your father, I suppose he must have worked on the allotments?</P>
<B><P>A 46.09 –M&#9;</B>Yes always.  It wasn’t the allotments by the church, but the ones at the end of School Lane.  In fact at one point I think he may have had two allotments.  And they were bordering on the river, there was a lovely damson tree by one of them.  [<B>S</B> – And when we were down Broadway Lane, they had quite large gardens and he used to dig that at night by electric light because he was working all day.  [<B>M</B> - I can also </P>
<P>remember as well hanging torches on the washing line, because that was the only time he could do the work, as he was working all hours.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 46.56</B>&#9;Did your mother work at all?</P>
<B><P>A 47.00 – S&#9;</B>Oh yes, she was the secretary at the school, before Martin was born in 1953. [<B>M</B> - But not only as secretary, she also acted as a sort of welfare assistant, and a dinner lady as well.  I’ll tell you what else I remember about dinner times at primary school, Mrs Dorling used to come up with a tray of sweets to sell in the playground, and we used to buy National Savings stamps with pictures of Princess Anne and Prince Charles on, and then later on we could buy peanuts at playtime, because I can remember mum collecting in the peanut money and counting it.  I can also remember when the school had a telephone installed, because the head was teaching, Mr Peyman was teaching one of the oldest class used to sit in the office, when my mother wasn’t there, just waiting for the telephone to ring, and if it did and it was a message for the head that needed to be answered immediately, we had some sort of bell system, and you rang the bell there and it sounded down in the village hall, and he would disappear and go and answer the phone.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 48.41</B>&#9;Fairly makeshift, the whole thing really?</P>
<B><P>A 48.45 – M&#9;</B>Absolutely, I certainly remember lining up in the playground to go down to the hall for dinners.  </P>

<B><P>Q 49.00</B>&#9;What did you do on Mothering Sunday? </P>
<B><P>A 49.03 – M</B>&#9;I can certain remember on one or two occasions, going over to, I think it was probably Oaksey Woods with Mrs Cussons, Diana Cussons, picking primroses and bluebells and then coming back either to the church or the vicarage, and bunching up little posies of flowers ready for Mothering Sunday.  I also remember one year making dozens and dozens of palm crosses, because somebody had decided it was cheaper to make them that to buy them ready made, and I took one apart to find out how it was made, and made dozens and dozens of palm crosses for Palm Sunday.  And I think children’s church was introduced when we were children, because before that we’d had Sunday School down at the school.  Miss Hall used to run the Sunday School and then I think it was David Payne that introduced children’s church; we had our own little service and we used to read the lessons ourselves and sing choruses, I remember that.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 50.17</B>&#9;Did you go on what I would call a nature walk?</P>
<B><P>A 50.23 – M</B>&#9;Dad often used to take us for a walk down the canal on a Sunday, while mum was getting lunch, and seemed to know what every bird sound was, and what every bush and every tree was.  Mr Chambers I think used to occasionally take us on nature walks from school.  I can certainly remember him taking us into the Downings and reading us stories out there, and possibly pointing things out on the way.  [<B>S</B> - Certainly dad did know a lot about the countryside.  I suppose when you are a child you don’t realise it, it’s only later on that you realise how much they did know, and how much they taught you.  [<B>M</B> – and how many wild flowers that you know the names of, perhaps not the Latin names, but the common ones.  [<B>S</B> – that was a good walk down there. [<B>M</B> - and he was able to find bird’s nests as well.  <B>[S</B> – I was very keen on bird’s nests, I was always late coming home from school in the nesting season, because I had been looking in the hedges. <B>[M</B> – and also there were those very tall Forsythia bushes that were along the wall of the South Cerney House, the ones that Mr Laws used to keep so beautifully trimmed.  There were often bird’s nests there in the summer. [<B>S</B> – and wagtails around the water of course.</P>

<B><P>Q 51.46</B>&#9;Did you know Mr Griffiths at Crane Farm?</P>
<B><P>A 51.55 -M</B>&#9;We knew of him, we were a little bit scared of him, because if we went for a walk down there, we would walk quite quickly.  [<B>S</B> – He had a dog that used to come rushing out. [<B>M</B> – there was an old mule that used to live down there as well wasn’t there? That used to look over the gate.</P>

<B><P>Q 52.12&#9;</B>Did you father come from South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 52.15 -S</B>&#9;Cerney Wick.  He came here when he was 7, I think.</P>

<B><P>Q 52.23</B>&#9;And your mother?</P>
<B><P>A 52.24 - M</B>&#9;South Cerney born and bred</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 52.30</B>&#9;What was her name?</P>
<B><P>A 52.32 –S&#9;</B>Hilda Gassor, she was. [<B>M</B> – eldest of three sisters, Millie and Muriel, being her two younger ones.  All three of them went to the grammar school, and I think in those days that was quite an achievement wasn’t it?  Dad unfortunately never did, but he did admit a few years ago, that he failed the 11+ on purpose, or the entrance exam, or whatever it was, but whether this was true or not, we don’t know,  but apparently a couple of the decided that they didn’t want to go, so they failed the exam on purpose.  But all three of them went to the Grammar School. [<B>S</B> and they used to cycle to school then. [<B>M</B> - I remember mum saying they used to wear very thick black stockings., which of course they hated, so cycling back the used to get about as far as the Camp, and take them off.  We’ve still got some of her exercise books, and she was quite a talented botanist, wasn’t she, and mathematician, and she went on to work in Lloyds Bank in Cirencester, and I believe she was one of the first women on the counter.  I remember her telling us stories about not being allowed to carry the money upstairs; the men were allowed to carry the money, but the women weren’t.  She used to do fire watches in Cirencester during the war.  [<B>S</B> – Mum was very involved in many societies here, mostly as treasurer. [<B>M</B> – Although in the players, she acted on the stage for quite a while, and when she no longer acted, she acted a prompt for many years.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 54.35</B>&#9;When did they actually get married?</P>
<B><P>A 54.36</B>&#9;1942.  At the third attempt wasn’t it, it was just a case of when dad could get a couple of day’s leave.  We actually found a wedding invitation, when we were turning out and it didn’t have a date on it – it had a blank space for the date, so it could be filled in whenever they could find time when he was on leave to get married.  I think they had one night’s honeymoon in London or something.  </P>
<B><P>55.16 –M&#9;</B>We discovered that he’s actually been drawing since he was about 19, because we found details of a correspondence course that he did when he was about 19.  [<B>S</B> – But he actually won a prize in Woman’s Friend. [<B>M</B> – Umpteen prizes in Woman’s Friend.  But we’ve certainly found a couple of books with caricatures of all of the cast and some of the production team of The Farmer’s Wife, which he was in and my mother was in, obviously …(?), Kath and Auntie Millie, and I think it lapsed, it lulled to a certain extent when we were small, just the odd sketch when we were children, I remember sitting for him to draw me once. [<B>S</B> – and he always drew on the side of a newspaper. [<B>M</B> – but I think it was really not until we moved into Orchis that he started drawing really seriously again, and then it was Cotswold buildings. [<B>S </B>– But again I think it was time, all your children off your hands and not so much hassle around you, more space for you rather than your family. [<B>M</B> – Was he actually one of the founders of the Art Club when it started out?  I’ve a feeling it was him and Ann Kings who used to live at Lower Mill, they started the Art Club.  They used to have regular exhibitions in the village hall, and he had two paintings in an exhibition in London, one of which he won a prize for, which was another correspondence course, which I don’t think he ever took up, but our one claim to fame his prize was presented by Tony Curtis.  So we have a lovely picture of dad and Tony Curtis, dad looking very tatty and Tony Curtis looking very smart.  But he’s produced post cards of the village, he used to produce his own Christmas cards which he used to sell.  I think there are very few houses in South Cerney without one of dad’s paintings actually.  Certainly the older houses.  I don’t know whether he took it up a lot again after he had that accident.  When he couldn’t work and he had about six months off when he was laid up, and I think perhaps that’s when he really started again, because he had the time to do it, and he needed something to fill the time and he couldn’t even get out on the garden then for a while.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 58.26</B>&#9;Do mention the sweet peas</P>
<B><P>A 58.29 –M</B>&#9;For as long as I can remember they have grown sweet peas, not your average grow them up pea sticks, they were each plant individually trained up a bamboo cane, and we are not talking about just a few, we’re talking 500 or 600 and they used to enter all the local shows, I can remember them going as far as Stroud, Cheltenham, Chippenham, usually in the back of  Jim Stayte’s lorry, winning cups, medals, prizes, but they also used to supply the florist, Jefferies in Cirencester with sweet peas as well in later years.  They used to have then bunched up 10 or 12 to a bunch in an individual colour rather than in mixed bunches, and I can remember mum particularly, being horrified at the price Jefferies where charging for them, I mean they would do an enormous bunch for 10 shillings, and Jefferies would sell 12 stems for about 5/6 or something.  They supplied Jefferies for a long time.  Local weddings, people would come along and say have you got this colour have you got that colour that we can put in the church, so they were really well known over a wide area for their sweet peas, dad had even exhibited at the National Sweet Pea Show up in London as well. I think he won a prize a couple of times, but obviously the competition up there was extremely fierce.  </P>

<P>Tape 8 – Sheila &amp; Margaret Continued</P>

<B><P>Q 00.17&#9;</B>Was it recently that he put them in a jug outside the house?</P>
<B><P>A 00.19</B>&#9;No. He’d always sold them over the wall, even before we moved up into the village.  We perhaps didn’t sell them over the wall then, but people would come down to the house to buy them. [<B>S</B> – As long as I can remember we have sold sweet peas, because when we lived down The College, when I was a very little girl, we, as children, used to take them along to people who had bought them and I obviously thought this is what you did to make money, and I picked buttercups and daisies from the field outside the college and did them up with wool, I can still see the little bowl now that we took with us, and we sold them round the village and my mother was horrified and made us take all the money back to the people, but this was obviously something that I thought was perfectly normal, that you took flowers and sold then to people,  But even to last year 1997, we’ve still got a heap of cards and rosettes that he won for his sweet peas and other flowers and fruit and vegetables.  [<B>M</B> – latterly he had started growing enormous onions as well, hadn’t he?  [<B>S</B> – and carnations he showed for the first time last year, and won first prize and a cup for, but sweet peas have always been the thing.  [<B>M</B> – and they were so labour intensive as well, they demanded a lot of attention, they had to be trained up the sticks, every side shoot had to be cut off, every tendril had to be cut off, every dead flower had to be cut off, and when they got to the top of the sticks you had to cut them down and lay them all down and start them up again, the hours they must have spent.</P>

<B><P>Q 00.03</B>&#9;The me about your mother’s</P>
<B><P>A 00.06 –M</B>&#9;Well mum was always keen to develop a new variety of sweet pea, her one ambition was to develop a yellow sweet pea.  You’ve got every shade of pink, blue, purple, but no yellow; there’s quite a deep cream.  She even tried crossing it with, we used to call in hens and chickens, I don’t know the proper name of it, a wild flower, but with no success, so she then just went on to developing other colours, and the one she was most fond of and the one dad called Hilda’s pink is a lovely shade of pink, which we are still trying to carry on.  That was actually trialed, but it wasn’t a very successful year.  [<B>S</B> – No it wasn’t a successful year and they suggested they did it again, then mum was ill and they didn’t do that, but Pete Read is continuing to grow it for us and maybe one day we’ll submit it again.</P>
