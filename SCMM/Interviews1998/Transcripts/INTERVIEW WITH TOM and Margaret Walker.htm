<B><P>Q (41.36)&#9;</B>And yours?</P>
<B><P>A (41.40)&#9;</B>I started out as a shop assistant and finished as a buyer in Edinburgh</P>
<B><P>Q (41.48)&#9;</B>Where were you married?</P>
<B><P>A (41.50)&#9;</B>In Edinburgh.</P>
<B><P>Q (41.53)&#9;</B>When did you first come to this area?</P>
<B><P>A (41.55)&#9;</B>28 years ago last month</P>
<B><P>Q (42.01)&#9;</B>That wasn’t the first time I think?<B>&#9;</P>
<P>A (42.04)</B>&#9;No, we lived here for a short while in 1942, when Tommy was at Kemble</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q (42.14)</B>&#9;What was it like being in this area in wartime?<B>&#9;</P>
<P>A (42.19)</B>&#9;As now, it was the best thing we ever did to come to South Cerney.</P>




<P>In wartime it was quite interesting in fact, because in Kemble all the aircraft that left this country, left from Kemble.  It was very interesting indeed.</P>




<B><P>Q (42.36)</B>&#9;So you had to maintain things?<B>&#9;</P>




<P>A (42.38)&#9;</B>Yes we maintained them and got them from the manufacturers and handed them over to the service personnel.</P>





<B><P>Q (42.45)&#9;</B>So you were checking them over?<B>&#9;</P>
<P>A (42.47)&#9;</B>Yes Certainly</P>
<B><P>A (42.50)</B>&#9;There were some lovely shops in Cirencester in the 40’s.</P>

<B><P>Q (43.00)&#9;</B>How many children do you have?<B>&#9;</P>




<P>A (43.02)</B>&#9;One daughter married with a son and daughter, so we’ve got 2 grandchildren.</P>





<B><P>Q (43.10)&#9;</B>What made you settle finally in South Cerney?<B>&#9;</P>




<P>A (43.13)&#9;</B>Because our daughter was stationed at Lyneham she was aircrew and when we were in Edinburgh we didn’t see her enough so we decided to come so she could visit more often.</P>
<B>




<P>Q (43.30)&#9;</B>Then what happened?<B>&#9;</P>
<P>A (43.32)&#9;</B>She got married and went to live in Cyprus for 3 years.</P>





<B><P>Q (43.38)</B>&#9;You were both born a long way from Gloucestershire any regrets in settling here?<B>&#9;</P>




<P>A (43.44)&#9;</B>No none whatsoever</P>
<B>
<P>Q (43.50)</B>&#9;What do you think is special about South Cerney?<B>&#9;</P>




<P>A (43.53)&#9;</B>The people.  I don’t know anybody that’s not helpful and kind, and Raymond’s mother was very kind to me when I first came here, she got me to join the music group, she was a church member and got me to go to All Hallows church, so no regrets at all.</P>
<B>




<P>Q (44.18)&#9;</B>You have been presented with the community cup, what is it for?</P>




<B><P>A (44.25)&#9;</B>Well I just think it’s services to the village that I think most people get it for, I don’t think we have done more than anybody else.</P>





<B><P>Q (44.34)&#9;</B>What have you done particularly in the last year?&#9;</P>




<B><P>A (44.37)</B>&#9;That’s a very difficult question to answer.  Nothing particularly but it’s nice to think that people have noticed what has been done by us for other people mainly, so it has been very enjoyable.</P>
