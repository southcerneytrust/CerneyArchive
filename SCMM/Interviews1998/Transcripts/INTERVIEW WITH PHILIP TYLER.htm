<B><U><FONT SIZE=2><P>INTERVIEW WITH PHILIP TYLER</P>
</U>
<P>Q 45.01&#9;</B>Where did you come from?</P>
<B><P>A 45.03&#9;</B>We lived Buckinghamshire, in a small village on the Thames<B> </B>called<B> </B>Bourne End.<B>&#9;</B>I came because my work brought me to Swindon.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 45.15</B>&#9;What was your work?</P>
<B><P>A 45.17</B>&#9;It was involved with reclaiming plastics, trading in them, and eventually there was a change of management in Swindon and I started my own business, which for sometime I ran from the house.</P>

<B><P>Q 45.36</B>&#9;Did you employ anybody locally from Cerney Wick or South Cerney? </P>
<B><P>A 45.39</B>&#9;No.</P>

<B><P>Q 45.34</B>&#9;What was the date that you came?</P>
<B><P>A 45.47</B>&#9;1 August 1971.</P>

<B><P>Q 45.51</B>&#9;And what did you find going on in Cerney Wick?</P>
<B><P>A 45.54</B>&#9;There was gravelling, which is now the Cotswold Sailing Club, they were still digging furious for the M4 and bringing the gravel out through the village and coming out near the Cripps’ house and then turning right on to the main road which then went through Cricklade.  When I was working in Swindon I had to travel through the centre of Cricklade every day, as did the gravel lorries.  Fairly soon afterwards they opened the Spine Road, a couple of years after we came here, the tail end of the Spine Road, and that relieved the village of all those heavy lorries so that was a blessing.</P>

<B><P>Q 46.56</B>&#9;What was the local………………(?) with the church?</P>
<B><P>A 47.02</B>&#9;The church?  First of all they were celebrating.  They had paid for the re-roofing of the church, and the money they had borrowed had all been paid back, and that happened very soon after we arrived.  The village itself was rather proud of it, because there had been a threat to close the church rather than spend the sort of money that they needed.  Anyway they got it and the church has carried on with a very much smaller congregation ever since.</P>

<B><P>Q 47.40</B>&#9;Where there still local people then?</P>
<B><P>A 47.43</B>&#9;Yes there were several local people here, but gradually they either died or moved away.  The farmland disappeared fairly quickly, Mr Freeth used to farm next door to us for quite a number of years, and the gravellers moved to other places, but unfortunately now, all around us is going to be gravel eventually.  Gravellers own a lot of the land that Archie owned and which he refused to sell to them but after he did it was sold fairly quickly to them, but it is still being farmed today on a lease basis until they need it. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 48.38</B>&#9;Do you know of any plans to use it ………………………?</P>
<B><P>A 48.44</B>&#9;The land down the bottom here; they plan to dig it and make a place for wildlife, I don’t think there is room for any leisure industry or anything like that, we hope not anyway.  It goes right down to the river, and access isn’t wonderful so I can’t see that being very much opened up.  There is also, I’m told, plans to bring gravel out by a conveyor to the Spine Road, and after all that’s finished they’ll plant a lot of trees, but whether that comes about I don’t know, but that’s what they are talking about.  After we got settled, people like Mrs Clifford died, who owned the big house on the corner, the Wheatley’s were here and they moved away, and Simon Taffinder started his very successful little nursery, but it’s now come back to being privately owned.  And the village mainly, is one of people who work outside and retired people, like myself, and about 3 or 4 houses that are only used as a second home, which we think is a great pity.</P>

<B><P>Q 50.25</B>&#9;When you arrived here were there amenities like mains drainage?</P>
<B><P>A 50.27</B>&#9;No, it’s still not on, it’s all non-mains drainage.  We had mains water and electricity and that is all the village still has.  The expense of bringing mains drainage is great.  The only thing is there is some land in the village that could be built on and if there is pressure from government to build more houses as they have done in South Cerney, then they will have to do something about drainage.  Any new houses that have been built have had to have special, something much better than the ordinary soak away, septic tanks.</P>

<B><P>Q 51.18</B>&#9;You mentioned the village hall committee?</P>
<B><P>A 51.23</B>&#9;It had during the war the hut, the village hall, had been used for dances, and they collected quite a lot of money, and the plan was to build a new village hall.  The brewers had given a bit of land, which is still a playing field, in order to put it up, but when we came to look at money we found a good deal more in terms of securities and that sort of thing than we imagined, in fact I think I was the first treasurer, and we re-invested some of it, but gradually it’s been used up.  There has never been a need …….(?) for some money to make a proper now hall.  Talking about it again now maybe we can sell off the old site, and raise some money there, maybe something could be done with …….(?) grant if that were possible.  And so really, you’ve got a village that is inhabited mainly by commuters and retired people.  A few, like John Parsloe and one or two others have been here for many years, and so that’s nice, but they are very much in the minority.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 53.07&#9;</B>Do you know anything about the history of the pub?</P>
<B><P>A 53.15&#9;</B>Not really. There were two pubs at one stage, but one was pulled down through lack of use, before the war, the land’s still there and it’s derelict, opposite Diana’s.  She is about the one business, Diana’s nursery that is in the village that is actually working.  That and the pub.  There’s nothing else, and the riding stable I suppose.  When we came the Giles’ were in the pub, eventually he died and she carried on, it was too much for her and lost business and eventually she left all in a great flurry of publicity  and all the rest about evictions and goodness knows what and it was taken, I think they brought in new landlords and we had about 3 or 4 in succession; all of them failed for one reason or another and eventually the present people took it over and made a great success of it, they really revived it, and now it’s a very busy pub.  I suppose that really brings us on to where we are today and the village itself, which is reeling under this road thing.  Today it’s not too bad you can just hear it, but yesterday it was appalling; we were sitting out here and it really was noisy, and we all feel that we  have been badly deceived by the Highways Authority.  They came to us late and their plans were well advanced before they gave us details of it, we got a little bit of a ….? From their initial meeting, we didn’t realise it was so long, it went to public enquiry. They wouldn’t allow the ….? to be extended.  The got round the inspector, they told him they weren’t sure what the surface was going to be.  I think the Highways Authority must have known that it was going to be concrete because concrete has been discussed and they said it was not significantly louder than tarmac.  We know that tarmac is much quieter, you only have to drive along it, and they have built these concrete roads elsewhere, they have had complaints from two or three other people and we know of 3 places where they have put this concrete down and they have had complaints from the residents, but they would not do anything about it and now they impose it on us, and it’s wicked, how these non-elected people can get away with it, and the ministers say oh well it’s cheaper.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 56.40&#9;</B>How has the village been protesting?</P>
<B><P>A 56.44</B>&#9;We’ve already made our complaints, with protest walks across the main road and we’ve had an article in the Guardian, television interviews, radio interviews, Gloucester and Swindon, and we continue to send little niggles to either the minister, the MP or the Highways Authority.  So it’s just been niggling on, I think it is unlikely that we shall get very much further, but you never know.  All we can hope is if they ever intend to bypass anywhere else and at present it doesn’t seem like they are going to make anymore roads at all, let alone extend this one, which I suppose is good for us really, if they extend it will bring more traffic won’t it?  I do hope that these people will be much more careful because studies have been made certainly down in Norfolk, they built one in Wyndham, and the local town council did extensive studies, and it’s quite conclusive that the Highways Authority knew exactly hat it was like and they said they didn’t, all their measurements were theoretical, and based on base levels which are very kind to the Highways Authority. It’s been a wicked thing, it really has.  The extra expense would have been negligible in their terms.</P>

<B><P>Tape 15 – Philip Tyler Continued</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 58.50</B>&#9;Tell me about the riding school</P>
<B><P>A 00.08</B> &#9;Oh the riding school.  Our elder daughter Nicola became very keen on riding, she started before we came here and we were very pleased to carry that on.  She went up to Helen Dorling and had a great time and then Helen ceased up there because she couldn’t work any longer from South Cerney and at the same time the man who owned the piggery where Helen Dorling now is had stopped trading because of the smell and it had been bought by somebody in the Army, who then agreed to lease it to Helen and really Nancy did a lot of the introductions and Helen has been there every since and has flourished by the look of it, which is great.</P>

<B><P>Q 01.20</B>&#9;What was the name of the farmers around here?</P>
<B><P>A 01.26</B>&#9;Initially when we came there was Arthur Webb and Archie Freeth and that was it nobody else.  The Webb’s land was gradually, I think they bought all the land from him and leased back the bits they weren’t going to use, until they wanted to use it now it’s all gone.</P>

<B><P>Q 02.01</B>&#9;The Webbs went where?</P>
<B><P>A 02.03</B>&#9;The Webbs left and went up to Hailstone Farm, near Cricklade, and they farmed there for several years until they gave up, and Archie Freeth continued to farm and continued not to have anything to do with the gravellers, and it was only after he died, because he left his money mainly to charity and the charity people wanted the maximum return for the farm, so they sold it off to the gravellers.</P>

<B><P>Q 02.46</B>&#9;Where are the new houses that have been built……………………?</P>
<B><P>A 02.50</B>&#9;There’s one in the so called street part of the village, there’s an old one opposite that which was Mollie Johnson’s, that’s been improved, then there are there much bigger, more expensive houses on the edge of the village on the right coming down from South Cerney.  One house at the end of the village that the Young’s had.  Squadron Leader Young was killed in a very nasty aircraft accident, and his wife still lives there, but they extended an outbuilding into what is now a very nice house, so that’s the next one.  Next door, Archie Freeth’s house has been extended and renovated and the 2 barns at the back have been converted, so you’ve got those few, 3,4,5 about 7 buildings which are now houses which were agricultural in the main.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 04.24</B>&#9;Your next door neighbours in Cricklade have wonderful flora in the meadows ……………?</P>
<B><P>A 04.34</B>&#9;We can walk down fairly easily across the Thames, we’re about half a mile from the Thames and over there is the top end of Cricklade meadow that’s nice, but the land that had held fritillaries, when we first came doesn’t any longer it has been fertilisied so that’s it, end of story, but they are still very pleasant meadows, unfortunately we don’t see a lot of them. Dug up eventually, but the gravellers have got together and where they wanted gravel for the new road at the back of the Creamery they excavated a very large pit and they are excavating land between the new road and the canal, and I think they are going to be there for several years, so perhaps the Cerney Wick meadows will be safe for some time yet to come.</P>

<B><P>Q 05.57</B>&#9;inaudible question</P>
<B><P>A .06.00</B>&#9;When we first came they were furiously digging the pit that is now the jet-ski lake, and they found an enormous amount of gravel and they went down much higher than the cab of a lorry, they were dry digging it and they went right down and liked what they saw, then they went to the County Council, I think, and said we would like to continue this across the road, and we’ll take the road and build you a new one, and the new one was going to come down from where the Sports Centre entrance is straight down the village, and the village was too late to protest against the outline plans and we, though the village hall committee, we found out that there was some law that said if a road was to be stopped and handed over to who then owned it, because Hills owned both sides of the road by then, the residents of that village could protest to the local council.  The local council wasn’t very keen on this and we weren’t very keen, because it would come straight off the Spine Road and be a racetrack down to the village.  And we stopped them, they just wouldn’t risk it, it was going to be too expensive.  So we really thought that was quite a win in those days.</P>

<B><P>Q 09.14</B>&#9;Would you like to just mention the fact that this is happening?</P>
<B><P>A 09.25</B>&#9;As far as the church is concerned, its 150<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary of consecration is coming up at the end of this month, and fortunately our very small congregation is likely to be joined by people from South Cerney and Down Ampney, but gradually as the older people move away from the village, or die, the congregation has got smaller and smaller and it doesn’t seem as if any of the newcomers are likely to use the church much, so one wonders what is going to happen.</P>

<B><P>Q 10.20</B>&#9;Is there any sort of resentment from Cerney Wick to big brother South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 10.26</B>&#9; The only resentment I have heard recently is that South Cerney Parish miserably supported us on the road, we had very little from them, the odd letter was sent and that was it, I got the standard reply and left it at that, and to a great extent the same applies to Gloucestershire County Council, they did nothing for us, as unfortunately the road that runs past us is in Wiltshire rather than in Gloucestershire, and so we’ve suffered badly at that.</P>
