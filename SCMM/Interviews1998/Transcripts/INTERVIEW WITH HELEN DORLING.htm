<B><U>
</U><P>Q 22.48</B>&#9;&#9;Were you born in South Cerney?</P>




<B><P>A 22.50&#9;</B>No, I was born in Uganda.  My father came from the East End and my mother from Lincolnshire, but my father had been an evacuee in South Cerney in the First World War, so he remembered it, and when they came back from Uganda before the Second World War, he then came and got the shop from Mr Hicks, as it was then.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 23.22&#9;</B>Do you remember the early part of the war?</P>
<B><P>A 23.23&#9;</B>I can remember some of the prisoners of war, because the used to make us rings out of the aircraft perspex when they crashed</P>
<B>
<P>Q 23.39</B>&#9;What about rationing?</P>
<B><P>A 23.41&#9;</B>The only thing I can remember about rationing was that we used to get bananas because my father had the shop and also sweets were rationed, and being a child that was most important, and rationing went on with sweets a long time after the war, and I can remember my mother giving us out worst chastisement we had as children because we had been to Miss Lane, who had the sweet shop then, my sister, my brother and I fought over the sweets on the way back and dropped them.  My sister got a smack, I got a smack, my brother came in laughing because we’d been smacked, so he got a smack as well.  So we all got chastised over the sweets.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 24.30&#9;</B>When did you start riding?</P>
<B><P>A 24.32&#9;</B>Apparently, I’d been riding from the moment I could possibly find somebody with a horse, I can’t remember the very early days, but I can remember going to a lady who used to be in the Old Mill House in School Lane that had a pony and I think I must only have been about 10 or 11, then I went to a riding school that was run my a Mr Tarrant, where the Querns Lane School is now, I went there, and then when I was coming on for 11 I went to the Grammar School, and my father said if I did well I could have my own pony, which was an immediate incentive to do very well, and I got my first pony then from Mr Webb, who was known as Grampy Webb.  Who did horse dealing as well as having a dairy farm in Silver Street?  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 25.39&#9;</B>When did you start competing?</P>
<B><P>A 25.41&#9;</B>I don’t compete for the first two years that I had my own pony.  I belonged to the Pony Club, but I was absolutely terrified of competitions and they used to take my pony and then use it for other riders, and after two years I got so fed up with other people having my pony that I started competing then in show jumping and went of from doing it then, but show jumping with that one I used to love, but I wasn’t a show jumping person, I liked showing better than show jumping with the horses.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 26.18&#9;</B>Who did you go to for advice?</P>
<B><P>A26.20&#9;</B>Well, as I said, it was the pony club that did all the training, there wasn’t anybody as such around like we have the Talland School now with Mrs Sievewright and things that you could go to locally as such so it was mostly through the pony club that I did most of my training in the younger years.</P>
<B>
<P>Q26.45&#9;</B>When did you start your own school?</P>
<B><P>A 26.47&#9;</B>I started my own school when I was 21, with 2 ponies in the backyard of my father’s shop.  I mainly started the school, because by that time I had<B> </B>left school when I was 18.  I wanted to be a vet, but we couldn’t get a grant for me to go to Bristol University, so went I to work for my father in the grocery shop, which was a disaster because I can’t add up money.  By that time I was already giving lessons to children on my own pony, so my parents said if you are going to do it, do it properly so they sent me to Porlock to do my exams and take my teacher’s training exam, and then I taught for 2 years in Cheltenham.  The school closed down because they were expanding the racecourse car park and I had the choice of either going with the Olympic team as a stable manager or doing my own school and by that time I decided I would like to go on to doing my own thing, so I moved back to South Cerney and as I say I started with the 2 ponies and went on from there.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 28.08</B>&#9;When did you come to Cerney Wick?</P>
<B><P>A 28.10</B>&#9;Cerney Wick, we moved down he 28 years ago, 28 years in September, so we’ve really become Cerney Wick people, but we’ve carried on with the name of South Cerney.  We’ve never moved back to South Cerney, because it became urbanised and not really enough room for a school and of course the situation here is ideal, because we are away from the main stream traffic with the children and with the disabled riders that we now specialise in.</P>

<B>
<P>Q 29.29&#9;</B>What ages come here?</P>




<B><P>A  29.30&#9;</B>We take them from 18 months to 80 years, or older if they want to ride.  But the 18 months only do ¼ of an hour.  They build up from ¼ hour, then ½ hour then an hour, and we do all sorts of activities here from doing picnic rides to show jumping courses for the younger children for British Horse Society stage 2 exams.&#9;And a lot of the children have now gone on to doing ….</P>
<B><P>&#9;</B>I taught for two years at Cheltenham Riding School, that closed down because Cheltenham Racecourse was expanding for their car park, then I had the choice of running my own school or going as a stable manager with the Olympic team at that time.  I decided that I wanted to do my own thing and came, as I was already teaching children here at South Cerney with my own 2 ponies, and we built up from the 2 ponies upwards.</P>

<B><P>Q 31.05</B>&#9;Can you tell me about riding for the disabled?</P>
<B><P>A 31.07</B>&#9;Yes, we’ve had a long association with Riding for the Disabled, started with one or two private people, then we started teaching the Paternoster School children from Cirencester, we have gone along and now we have 170 people, during the term time coming, both adults and children.  They cover a large area, Bibury, Cirencester, Swindon, Marlborough and Stroud, so that we cover a large area with riders, some come as groups with their schools or their adult training centres, others come as private people and of course getting a lot of fun and benefit from it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 31.51</B>&#9;Have you had any distinguished people?</P>
<B><P>A 31.55</B>&#9;Yes we’ve had people from Emmerdale Farm here, we’ve had various film stars, and also we have the chairman of Riding for the Disabled come and visit us and various times and Lord Oaksey has had quite a long association with us, starting with teaching his daughter, and now he calls in every now and then and sees the Riding for the Disabled with it, and also Lord Bathurst and of course, I taught the Bathurst children, which are now all grown up and also Lord Fanshawe’s children.</P>
<P>&#9;Another part the Riding School has played is with the opening up of the Water Park, we’ve had a great deal of help and we’ve also helped with the opening up of the bridle tracks.  We have now 20 miles of bridles tracks round the Water Park which we liaise on with the Water Park Rangers in keeping open, also the new A419 has opened up the Bridle tracks round Latton and Down Ampney, but as I say with a lot of forethought we have managed to put in a lot of gateways, what they call motor cycle traps to stop young lads riding motorcycles down the bridle tracks, and this has been going on now for about 20 years, and we are now hoping with the liaison with the Ramblers’ Association we are going to open up part of the tow path from here to Cricklade as a riding track as well, with the Riding School helping with the clearing of the trees and the sorting out of the bridle path alongside of the canal.</P>

<B><P>Q 34.08</B>&#9;Inaudible question</P>
<B><P>A 34.13</B>&#9;Some of the riders that have started as children here have gone on to ride in a bigger sphere, a couple of notable ones were Jonathan Bowman, whose father used to be a butcher in South Cerney, he has now gone on with the help of Talland School, their now competing in the British European Team, he will be jumping in Belgium next week.  Also we have Lousie Cullum, who is now competing in the Prince Philip Team and is going on to compete on the August Bank Holiday in France.  And also Simon Cox, who is now running a British polo team and competing in the polo sphere, so even though they start very young, there is the hope that one day they might be competing in European and hopefully later on in the Olympics.</P>
