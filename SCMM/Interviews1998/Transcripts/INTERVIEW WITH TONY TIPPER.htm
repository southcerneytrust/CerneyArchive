</U><P>Q (0.30)</B>&#9;Where did you live when you were young?</P>




<B><P>A (0.32) &#9;</B>I used to live at Ablington, just outside of Bibury</P>




<B><P>Q (0.36)&#9;</B>How old were you when war broke out?</P>




<B><P>A (0.42)&#9;   &#9;</B>Six or seven</P>




<B><P>Q (0.45)</B>&#9;What memories do you have of Cerney camp during the war?</P>
<B><P>A (0.48)</B>&#9;I remember my father taking me up there when the place had been constructed I think it was open for the general public to have a look round.  Being as my father worked in construction I think he did a little there with the different trades that were involved in the and construction of the camp.</P>
<B><P>&#9;</B>I recollect it was a long way to walk up there, but we did it.  I do remember when the camp was actually opened and it gradually developed as the war approached to more building going on.  Originally it had the main hangars that were there, but then more hangars were built during the war years and all sorts of funny thing went on that were supposed to be hush hush, but it is recorded on the scenes as development from war years.  Some is vivid and some is not so vivid, but I do remember when troops started pouring into the area and of course they were brought in by train or whatever transport was possible.  I remember again, as this area had been a military establishment as more and more troops came in more and more airfields were opened up until the final day of the Normandy landings, when everybody disappeared at once.  There was a huge build up of troops etc etc.</P>

<B><P>Q (2.44)&#9;</B>What was the LVD?</P>
<B><P>A (2.47)&#9;</B>Local volunteers defence.  They were people who volunteered they knew war was coming.  I suppose the Government did put a lot of information about that there was a fifth column element that spreading across the country and right on South Cerney’s doorstep we did have quite a gathering of German Jews, and the suspicion had been implanted in people’s memories.  One of my vivid memories was being told by someone working on the Kemble airfield, when that was under construction, and he was an eye witness to someone being pulled out of a tree by the police who was actually spying on the camp.  I put two and two together, because he said that the person was pulled out of the tree by his beard, and I assumed that it was a German Jew, but as far as I know this is how I put two and two together and came up with the wrong answer.  I’ve got no idea who it was, but the police arrested him and he was whisked away pretty rapid.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q (4.10)&#9;</B>What did the LVD become?</P>
<B><P>A (4.12)</B>&#9;It became the Home Guard.  As the Home Guard was hastily put together making use of anything that could be used.  I think the strongest fire power they had was a double barrelled shot gun, but I did speak with some colleagues who were involved in it, namely Jim Stayte, who was a sergeant and Frank Smith, who was another sergeant in the Home Guard.  I think they said they had one or two rifles and ten rounds.  And whoever went on guard took the rifles with them, all the rest had clubs, sickles and scythes, whatever people could lay their hands on.  I suppose as I’ve gained knowledge there had been a large import of Canadian rifles which were brought into the country pretty rapidly, and it was shared out as best it could be, but I think it probably went to the territorial forces, like the Gloucester Hussars or the Gloucesters.  As the munitions were built up then the Home Guard would have been issued with proper equipment, but there was an odd assortment of people in the Home Guard, but they were determined people.  I knew some of them and I knew they could have been nasty with the right instruments.</P>

<B><P>Q (6.14)</B>&#9;What happened after Dunkirk after 1940?</P>
<B><P>A (6.16)</B>&#9;There became a rapid build up here with the demand for gravel, because so much had to be built, bunkers, runways, concrete bases for Nissan huts, and as people were drawn into the conflict everyone had to carry their arms about with them.  It was pretty organised but it looked like a melee at the time.  Troops were hither and thither and bunkers were everywhere.  Troops seemed to be on guard on the crossroads and strategic points, railway bridges etc, and the Home Guard was appointed to look after one of the railway bridges that carried the main railway lines and traffic which was essential in its day for fear of saboteurs and fifth columnists.  And actually at Dunkirk everybody was a bit jittery and they did all sorts of things that they thought might improve, but I think in this area all people immediately after Dunkirk had to fight with, would have been something of a Molotov cocktail or anything of that nature.  So petrol had been stored in various places with bottles, but you’ve got remember that you could only use things like that in towns because you’ve got to break the bottles to do any good, they wouldn’t be any good on grass, but you could defend something like a bridge because you could smash something against a bridge and would fire it.  Good ideas but in this area just would not work.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q (8.19)</B>&#9;What precautions were taken for air landings?</P>
<B><P>A (8.24)</B>&#9;There had been tractors or horses and it had been a double plough sort of procedure and anything that could become an obstacle in the middle of a long field was actually dragged there and left there.  There had been a fear of some type of glider invasion.  I think the Home Guard may have been some match against the armed parachutists, because they couldn’t fight for very long but they still had to hold the line or wherever it was, and if you took the line of Southern England right the way through, we’re not too far from the bigger military bases of Salisbury Plain and there would have been plenty of troops, but the equipment was in short supply.  When we talk about anti invasion, there had been in the ditches all sorts of trip wires with hand grenades, so it was obvious that somebody was going to hide in the ditch so you put in the trip wires with the hand grenades and the object of the Home Guard at that time was to keep everybody’s head down rather than allow them to advance and keep them out of the airfields.  One of the big things which had been used and made pretty rapid was the blocking off of the roads, and most of the roads in the area had been staffed with huge concrete squares that could be rapidly pulled across or bundled into the road to stop traffic and make them bypass into rivers, or in this case canals, and although the canals were not working, there was a fair drop of water in it, and if you had an armoured thing you could quickly get it bogged down and you wouldn’t get any movement at all, so we did have a fighting chance.</P>

<B><P>Q (10.42)&#9;</B>What part did the RAF play at South Cerney camp in the 1940 battles?</P>
<B><P>A (10.45)&#9;</B>South Cerney camp just happened to be a three elementary flying training school and there were thirteen elementary training schools in the country before Dunkirk, and to get pilots into the sky they had to be trained in the pre-war years.  The war years were too late and South Cerney had been training the pilots of different types of aircraft and with the build up they were one of the thirteen flying schools would have been administrative and there were twelve actual frontline training places, so South Cerney must have a record of producing at least 1/12 of the pilots who actually fought at the battle of Britain of one type or another.  We always think of the Spitfires and the Hurricanes, but there were quite a few bomber crews that were actually striking at barges along the French coasts, so the pilots were here, all nationalities.  I think this is one of the things which the country was prepared for that we did have the pilots ready in the nick of time although we did lose an awful lot, but that is what South Cerney did provide for during and up to the war years.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (12.24)</B>&#9;In training did they have many crashes?&#9;</P>
<B><P>A (12.28)</B>&#9;Yes, there were quite a lot of crashes.  There was quite an amount of young flyers who were buried over Gloucestershire, but in our own county if they were pilots actually at the camp they were buried at South Cerney, and there is quite a gathering of young lives over in the churchyard.  And they were crashing all over the place because they were having to learn to fly at night without the modern aids that we use now, and it was just one of the difficult things, and on the airfield itself they couldn’t be too liberal with the flare paths or things like that because any bomber attack would pick them up as easy as pie, so it would have to be a bit of a Heath Robinson set up.  It did save an awful lot of pilots’ lives but there were quite a few lost.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q (13.29)</B>&#9;Is there any particular dogfight that you remember?</P>
<B><P>A (13.31)</B>&#9;Yes I do, there had been a dogfight over Cirencester.  There had been a training aircraft Hercules from one of our Polish brigades, and as I read records and I actually saw the fight taking place, I gather a bomber had been latched on to at a great distance and the two Poles that were actually flying there was with one of the British squadron leaders, and I suppose he actually tried to veer them away from a potential action, because although they were bombers they were armed with machine guns for shooting inexperienced people down.  But the Polish disregarded the actions which their commanding officer set them.  They literally had the blood in them and they went for him and caught him in the right place, which happened to be over Cirencester, and he actually dived and crashed in the grounds of Coates Manor.  Coates isn’t a great distance from South Cerney.  The people were buried at Coates for some considerable time, but after the war they were transferred to Cannock Chase German military graves, and I suppose they are there with their own nationals now.  All not realising what they actually died for.  That’s my recollection of it when I saw the aircraft in smoke and flames turned upside down.</P>
<B>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q (15.37)</B>&#9;What happened to the camp after the war?</P>
<B><P>A (15.39)&#9;</B>After the war?  It did still keep flying for quite a few years, but it gradually shrank because the glamour of the RAF had gone away then because places like Biggin Hill and places like that had the glamour of the Spitfires and South Cerney kept flying with the later type of aircraft. But it still provided pilots for cold war, should it be necessary, and it had been used again while it was still an RAF base as an international glider base and I remember back at that time there was pilots from all over the world and I went up there in typical British weather, it rained, and blew it wasn’t very good glider flying times, but there we are, they gathered and made the most of everything and that’s the first time in my life I had ever seen Russian pilots.  The Russian woman that was with the pilot was quite a thick set sort of person very strong and powerful.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (17.19)&#9;</B>When did you come to South Cerney to live?</P>
<B><P>A (17.20)</B>&#9;1957, I came here.  I happened to walk down Bow Wow Lane when I was out courting my wife, most of the courting couples used that as a walking place.  I saw this cottage which was derelict and I made enquiries whether they would actually sell it.  It belonged to Colonel Gibbs then who lived in the Manor House, I told him that I intended to get married and would he be prepared to sell the old cottage and he said certainly.  I purchased it and have been scratching about on it ever since.  I suppose I gradually became part and parcel of South Cerney, although I’ve known a lot of people who live in South Cerney from my school days, because they actually went to the same school as I did in Cirencester when they became a certain age. And I played football with a lot of people and soldiered with quite a few of them, so people of my age group we met in more circles than enough, but I had very strong links in South Cerney before.  I have relatives in different parts of the villages surrounding.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q (18.52)</B>&#9;When did mains sewerage first come to the village?</P>
<B><P>A (18.54)</B>&#9;That came in the 1970’s.  It was a long long time before the sewerage actually came to the village and from then on it allowed the village to develop.  Up until then most of the areas had large septic tanks and it’s like all amenities, as soon as amenities are put into the area it really takes off then, with the development of construction. Meadow Way came in 67 or 65 or something like that, so it was just one helping hand to get these amenities laying in and in fact the other supplies, like electricity had been in the village, but not in power units that’s required in modern days.  The village literally took off with the facilities coming in.  I remember when Robert Franklin Way was developed, but you’ve got to see it to believe it. The actual catch point for the sewerage system required an in depth system and the contractors started digging a hole there and hole developed almost into a small gravel pit, because there was water pumping round in circles continuously and it was a devil of a job to get the thing to work, because we are in such a low lying area with the water and it is difficult to get these amenities laying in and water tight and waterproofed, so I foresee just how it did take off.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (20.50)</B>&#9;What is the history of flooding?</P>
<B><P>A (20.52)&#9;</B>Well I think the history of flooding would possibly be when demand for water by human beings grew, the Water Authorities would pump a lot of water which would normally flow thorough this area, and the development of Swindon now would take vast amounts of water, and with the development also of the gravel pit, it stopped an awful lot of the flooding that South Cerney used to have.  Firstly by the demand of Swindon taking a lot of water and the gravel pit taking an awful lot of water itself, so I think that’s possibly stopped a lot of flooding in South Cerney.  The water used to flood quite regularly when I first moved into South Cerney in Bow Wow Lane, but it doesn’t flood there anymore, so you see the water table has dropped that much.  Although water tables, strictly speaking if I wanted to take a water gauge table I have got a well near the house, which I could see, it does go up in winter or summer months so it’s proof of the water being used, and that does change a lot of subjects on what the water tables are relevant to, whether its your bath or humans or not.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q (22.21)&#9;</B>Let’s talk about the gravel extraction, can you just start with how it was originally and then work up?</P>
<B><P>A (22.29)</B>&#9;Yes as I remember some of my colleagues who actually started on the very first gravel working; would dig by shovel, wheelbarrow and they would actually excavate gravel until they had wet feet basically, and then wellingtons and then the gravel pit would be left.  Later on probably the late thirties the Rushton Busirus(?) machine had been developed with a drag line and steam powered and two of the main companies, Hills and Bradleys had these different machines drag lines and the excavation then started digging on a deeper vein, now during the war years the gravel would be dug anyhow, by whatever method and with development of the different machinery so more development came in and demand for houses, more people moving into the area, South Cerney itself, this is more demand for more gravel.  When I talk about the local histories of this village we tend to forget that the village stands on gravel and the surrounding villages stand on gravel but the old cottages are stone, so everything had been imported, and stone had been brought in from varying different places.  The stone that actually came to build the village came from the back of the camp, Pogal Quars(?) always referred to it as.  People were employed there to excavate the stone by hand and paid so much per cubic yard.  The builders thought it was very good stone and the different villages that were built in the area all had their own stone hauled into or around, and churches had the stone from Burford or great distances away which was a different type of stone and that is another subject because stone from Burford is used in London quite a lot to build St Pauls and pieces of it, as a lot would know, so the area must have had a lot of stonemasons with the building and stone tiles and this sort of thing.  But the gravel gradually developed because the gravel and the concrete products is a quicker building process than hewn stone and stone tiles.  So that’s how the development started and actually got larger as the demand for these things came into being, right up to the building of the motorways where gravel was extracted on a large basis by lorry load.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (23.54)&#9;</B>Did the gravel workings increase the traffic?</P>
<B><P>A (25.59)&#9;</B>Yes it did, there was a full time job for the county roadmen to clean the gravel as it went round all the bends, in and out of the village, and no sooner had the wheelbarrow load been moved away there was as much there again within the hour.  And the great demand by the local inhabitants, the parish council and including the South Cerney Trust to put pressure on the council to get a bypass.  The old railway line had been suggested as a bypass, but it didn’t come to fruition, until one contractor who actually wanted to build a section of the M4 motorway and wanted the gravel desperately and was not allowed to haul the vast amounts of gravel out through the village, so they in turn offered the County Council to build a free roadway out to the A419, which is the Spine Road now, and the gravel that had been excavated was the county’s sailing pit, so when you walk past the county’s sailing pit, you realise just what amount of gravel  that had been taken from just one gravel pit to build the motorway and the gravel pits hadn’t actually been finished then.  There was a wet and dry working.  The wet working was used with a drag line; with a dry working was used pumps to pump the water into the river so the area was dry.  Now in Water Lane there had been a dry pumping there and underneath the dry pumping was a very had blue clay and this was sold the same as gravel and that built part of the Cricklade bypass and bridge and the whirly bit that goes up to the bridge is all blue clay from the bottom of the gravel pits.  It was used in both cases, the clay and the gravel.</P>
<B>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q (28.07)</B>&#9;Where there any archaeological discoveries?</P>
<B><P>A (28.12)</B>&#9;Yes, quite a few, there had been things drawn out with the drag line and with the big buckets, whatever was dropped it depended on the man who actually worked the bucket whether he reported an interesting find or not and if he thought there was something of interest he would report it to his superiors and there had been the head of a woolly rhinoceros brought out, it was a great curiosity to him and reported it to Bradley’s family who in turn did the right thing and reported it to the people of South Cerney and the South Cerney Trust that they actually found this.  Now Alice Mary Hadfield and Yvonne Perret, they were very keen on this type of thing and they actually said they would take it and do the necessary with it and it had been on display with an awful lot of artefacts that the South Cerney Trust did gather from the areas, but there had been other things beside the woolly rhinoceros.  There had been a piece of tree that had been sliced up into sections and different people who worked on the job were given a slice of and taken basically as a type of treasure trove.  Other bits and pieces there had been supposedly roman pieces there.  There was a Roman coffin dredged out of the gravel pit and who’s to say what else, but it’s only you find more artefacts now, if the gravel pits had been excavated dry a lot would not have been lost.  It had been lost because the things that were no good for the gravel industry were thrown back into the gravel pits and are probably still there now in the bottom.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (30.23)</B>&#9;Did you see any changes in the way people live now compared with the time of your arrival?</P>
<B><P>A (30.28)&#9;</B>Yes, I see one great thing now, when I first moved here the general trend was the tidiness of the village itself.  Most people were very proud of being British and very proud of being themselves and all the allotments were cultivated to the Nth degree, and Raymond’s mum used to chivvy the people on to keep it reasonably tidy and I think that was a good thing.  The general trend was that when people would meet on the bridge and they would discuss and a lot of the local people would have a meeting place on the bridge down the bottom of the road.  And if you look carefully you will find a lot of the bygone names of villagers carved there.  That’s regarded as vandalism now, but everyone carved their names in the stone, carved their names in trees and all this sort of thing.  And people would walk more and they would socialise more, but I think since the motor car, there were more bicycles about when I first moved to the village.  I cycled into Cirencester for quite a few years, but you don’t see very many people now.  I think cinemas were used more, the buses were a little bit more frequent, they were every hour until ten in the evening, so people would travel more on the buses, bicycle more, there was no restriction for people who wanted to swim in the gravel pits, whereas there is now.  I used to swim in the river on a certain section, which is in water Lane now, it’s Rainbow Lake, the river has actually been diverted, but there is a lovely swimming pool there.  There used to be quite a few men that would go there to swim and it was good jolly times, and we did an awful lot of walking about.  I think there was quite a lot of poaching until myxomatosis came along, and now you couldn’t give rabbits away.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q (32.56)&#9;</B>Tell me about the shops in the village.</P>
<B><P>A (32.58)&#9;</B>The shops in the village, they were still the old type of shops where you would wrap things in a paper bag and you sold things over the counter, and it was all weighed up and you would buy sweets in the sweet jars.  Now everything is pre-packed, but I always remember the smaller shops and I remember the eagle eyes of the school children when they went in with their halfpennies and their pennies to buy a few pennies’ worth of sweets and now it’s a different situation, because a penny will buy nothing and we have changed to decimalisation.  I wouldn’t go on about changing it, but I remember what the penny did buy.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q (33.44)</B>&#9;You’ve done a great deal of research into the history of the village and the camp, what do you think really inspires you?</P>
<B><P>A (33.51)&#9;</B>Curiosity.  I had been told things in the past and I thought well is it ever right? When you check back in history it’s not strictly true, a lot of it has been a lot by the powerful and the rich, who instructed the writers to write what they wanted to write, not necessarily so.  And I take a very strong attitude with all villages and all towns there was an awful<B> </B>lot of people who lived in the areas but there’s not much written about those people, there’s quite a lot written about the powerful and the rich, but there’s very little written about the people who lived in the houses or the cottages and I have a very strong interest in dating cottages, but I question myself, where did people live before they lived in the cottages.  They lived on the common lands you see, now you go back to land enclosures and commons enclosures so the people actually lived in there didn’t live in houses and cottages as we live in today, so they must have lived in some other type of shack for want of a better word, and I have a photograph of a type of Cotswold shack that was basically the sort of thing that you would put an animal in now.  And with the access to a little bit of stone and a little bit of timber and a little bit of coarse grass and you could make something of it, but that is where we lived before we actually lived in cottages.  I am very interested in that part; land enclosures, until the actual building of the cottages and it is difficult to find too much about, so I started to read a lot, study a lot, think a lot, talked to other people for their points of view and I do like to meet professional people who can get down to the nitty gritty bits.  I have myself spend quite considerable time in Gloucester archives, looking through different pieces of the area, not basically South Cerney, but the area, and it’s very interesting when you come up with these different bits and pieces and I’m pretty fortunate that I have met up with a lot of people who have been very kind and learned people who I have learned a lot from and their knowledge has rubbed of on me, and I’ve used it to a different purpose.  That’s what’s got me interested in to trace histories and this sort of thing.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q (36.52)</B>&#9;Can you just tell me about Mr Griffiths of Crane Farm?</P>
<B><P>A (36.58)</B>&#9;Yes, Tom Griffiths was an only son of the original farmer, I didn’t know the original farmer, but I knew his son, and he was one of the, if anyone said to me how would you explain the man, I would say he was a type of master craftsman of rural crafts.  He was a well known stonemason a knowledgeable person with country crafts, he could turn his hand to most things and with living where he was, which was quite a lonely spot, it had been used for the distribution of coal into the village.  I used to think it was just the wharf up above where Tom Sandall is now, but it wasn’t.  Coal had been off-loaded there and Griffiths’ had been used basically as a coal place, also with that there had been a reasonable orchard down there.  Now when you mention orchards in Gloucestershire, you mention cider, and I suppose with the people coming through in the long boats and this sort of thing it was mixture of selling some cider and bringing some cider to the village.  Now Tom, the one I that I knew, they were both Tom, he is vivid in my memory for the fact that the old methods of farming were still produced there; he cut the hay with a scythe and where he used to borrow the old ripper which would just cut the crass with a horse-drawn thing, he did some of that as well, but what he did with the hay, he actually made hayricks and thatched them, well that’s something that you don’t see now.  You never see thatching on a scale that Tom did, and you never see the summer ricks that the hay was absolutely dry.  He was very kind with animals, he regarded that animals had to be treated with extreme care and the stone pieces that he actually carved in the barn, and although he had an accident and lost one foot.  I used to go and see him and talk about the old days and the old times, and Tom used to talk about the lovely watercress that used to grow down in the beds and he was mortally wounded when the water was taken away by water companies with the draining of the artesian wells, which there were quite a lot of in this area.   And he was one of the characters who was easy going, part of the village, part of the little gang of fellows that were in the area, part of the football gang, always a willing hand to help with what was necessary to be done.  He was a sort of a long gangly sort of person, rather odd looking, but with a heart of gold and when you see some of the things he did on that farm it was a pleasure to actually go there and I did say to Tom would it be possible to take a party down there to give a little talk about rural history and trace histories and this sort of thing.  He said certainly, but it’s like everything in life, I want to do so much, but had a job to find the time for, and I never did get down to it and I feel somewhat let down, basically with my own, because I should have gone there with a group of people to pass on some of the knowledge that I had gleaned from him.  It’s meeting characters like that that you get to like the area, and he used to go into the canal and cut the Norfolk reeds with a scythe and all the thatching was done with reeds that were cut out of the canal.  I look at it now, and it’s just a shambles compared to what it used to be.  Lovely place you could date it back 100 years.  Now the house has gone and Tom’s gone and the situation’s gone, everything has changed.  We will never see those days back again, but you could step back in England 100 years on that farm, quite easily and you could sample a drop of good cider as well. But he was a very very kind and generous person.</P>

One of the prominent parts as you go along the road now is the fact that you see an odd house built in the gap where the aeroplane hit.</LI></OL>
