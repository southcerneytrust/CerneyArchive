<P>Tape 18</P>
<B><U>
</U><P>Q 45.05&#9;&#9;</B>Where do you come from Bill?</P>
<B><P>A 45.10&#9;&#9;</B>I’m actually from Newcastle, I’m a Geordie</P>

<B><P>Q 45.10</B>&#9;&#9;Were you in the Army during the war?</P>

<B><P>A 45.14</B>&#9;No I’m not that old, I joined the Army in 1949 and stayed in the Army all my adult life really and came out when I was 57.  I got to like it eventually; it was 38 almost 39 years, a super life.  </P>

<B><P>Q 45.41</B>&#9;Were you actually stationed here at the Camp?</P>
<B><P>A 45.43</B>&#9;No, I was never stationed here.  It was the house that brought us here in the first place.  We’d never been to the Cotswolds and South Cerney and so on.  The house was an Army house, and the Army was selling them off and when I saw it advertised, I started asking people, who I knew had served in South Cerney, and asked them what it was like and in every case the answer was lovely, buy it, go for it.  So we came to look at it and I said that’s it, we looked at the village of course and said lovely village, lovely area, lovely house, we shall stay here.</P>

<B><P>Q 46.19</B>&#9;Do you know much about the history…….?</P>
<B><P>A 46.25</B>&#9;I am the Chairman of the branch and I do know that the branch for formed in 1926, and it had gone down to about 11 members way back in the early 80’s and Tim Chappell, my predecessor set to and revived it really.  We now have about 100 members, which is very good.</P>

<B><P>Q 46.55</B>&#9;Are there any survivors from the 1914 War?</P>
<B><P>A 47.00</B>&#9;Not the 1914 War, no.  No we don’t have any I’m afraid.</P>

<B><P>Q 47.05</B>&#9;How many were serving in the last war?</P>
<B><P>A 47.12</B>&#9;I would say, and this is an absolute guess, I would think no more that about a dozen.  I’m raking rapidly through my brain trying to rake up the names, and I can’t.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 47.36</B>&#9;Do you have fundraising events?</P>
<B><P>A 47.42</B>&#9;Yes we do, not very often.  It’s a branch that meets only once a quarter, but we have about three or four entertainments a year when we do fundraising, apart from the Poppy Appeal collection of course, and the Poppy Appeal collection is largely people who are non-members.  They are volunteers in the village who go round and do house to house collections and so on, they are brilliant.  And every year since the branch was formed, certainly since Tim Chapell reformed it, and every year the collection has increased.  It was something round about £120 at one time, and now it’s about £2,000 odd.  There’s a lot of inflation, but clearly there’s a lot of collecting done by these excellent people.</P>

<B><P>Q 48.44</B>&#9;Inaudible question</P>
<B><P>A 48.47</B>&#9;We do a small gift to the widows of ex-service men, not necessarily members of course, at Christmas we give them a voucher to go and buy whatever they want, which is from our own funds. But we also make a donation to the Poppy Appeal, normally about £200 or something and we donate to BLESMA that’s the British (?) Ex-servicemen’s Association at Somerset Legion House, which apparently is a superb place, the Gloucestershire Wheelchair Fund and of course the Star and Garter Home which is for injured ex-servicemen.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 49.36</B>&#9;Are you planning any special events for the 80<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary of the ending of the 1914-18 War?</P>
<B><P>A 49.46</B>&#9;We’re not unfortunately, but the Legion centrally has committed itself to a number of events, the only one we are taking part in is Armistice raffle as they call it.  We have bought tickets for that, but we as a branch aren’t planning anything really.</P>

<B><P>Q 50.12</B>&#9;Inaudible question</P>
<B><P>A 50.23</B>&#9;Yes they do, the church was absolutely full on Remembrance Sunday, in fact last year the soldiers from the Camp here couldn’t all be seated they had to stand up down the side and over the back. Our involvement is small really; we do arrange the service with the vicar, and then we arrange the seating and so.  After the service of course we do a slow steady walk, I wouldn’t call it a march down to the memorial where we lay the wreaths from the Parish Council, the British Legion and the of course the Regiment up here.</P>

<B><P>Q 51.22</B>&#9;Does Cyril Stephens’ Corvette Association……?</P>
<B><P>A 51.27</B>&#9;No they don’t, because they meet the first weekend in September and of course they come from all over the country, consequently they can’t be represented here.  I think they have some central memorial where they put their wreath actually, the Corvette survivors.  In fact we have four of them come and stay here for that weekend.  One of them is quite a character actually, a chap called David Plume, he knowing that I was in the Army deliberately stopped outside the gate here and put the white ensign on his radio aerial, and then motors in with this flying behind him, the white ensign, trying to annoy me.  I do tell them, Royal Navy not allowed in here, get them out.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 52.43</B>&#9;Are there any particularly distinguished members in the local association?</P>
<B><P>A 52.57</B>&#9;No we haven’t really, we lost a good one last year in Vic Dyke.  Vic unfortunately passed away.  He had a great array of medals, Dunkirk and Normandy Veterans.  There’s Tom Sinclair who was Royal Air Force and I think his job was air sea rescue; they used to go out in these big rescue launches and pick up pilots that had dropped into the water.  He was at Dunkirk as well; I remember him telling me that when they got the word everybody scatter, make your own way back to England if you can.  They made their way down to Calais I think it was and he saw the Lancaster being bombed and sinking which was quite an awful thing to see really.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 54.08</B>&#9;Are there any of the later Korean …………?</P>
<B><P>A 54.14</B>&#9;That I know of, we don’t have any Korean veterans actually.</P>

<B><P>Q 54.18</B>&#9;Malaysia?</P>
<B><P>A 54.20</B>&#9;Well I was in Malaysia myself and I can’t think of anybody else in the branch who was in Malaya, they seem to be principally the war and very shortly after it.  Sadly it has the image of an old man’s organisation, which is very sad because the national president and the national chairman and so on, they were all in their thirties when it was formed back in 1921, not this branch the national of course, but today for some reason or other the young servicemen won’t join, they think when I get older I’ll join, which is rather sad because we do need these youngsters to be running the thing really, rather than just attending.</P>

<B><P>Q 55.25</B>&#9;Tell me a little bit about your career……….?</P>
<B><P>A 55.30</B>&#9;I had the best of both worlds, I was a …master(?) which meant I was chair borne most of the time, but the beauty of it was I could soldier when I had the opportunity.  I enjoyed soldiering, except when it came to lying in a ditch with a pool at the bottom of it, when it was pouring down with rain on Salisbury Plain at 4 o’clock in the morning.  I didn’t like those bits, in fact I remember we were having drink for a young soldier who was leaving the Army when we were in Germany, and I was within about 2 years of leaving, and I was saying to the RSM that I would miss the Army, having spent all my adult life in the Army and I would miss it enormously when I left, and he said well wait until it’s pouring down with rain, go to the bottom of your garden and dig a hole, lie in it all night and ring me the next morning and tell me if you miss it.  I haven’t done that, I got the point. I was lucky I had a very good spell in the Army, I got to see Malaya and Singapore, back to England over to Germany, saw the whole of Europe opening, Cyprus, East Africa, Hong Kong, Aden, Northern Ireland of course, Belize when Guatemala was rattling the sabre.  I’ve probably missed some out but it was very good, and all at your expense.</P>

<B><P>Q 57.27</B>&#9;Have you got any connection with the Falklands…….?</P>
<B><P>A 57.32</B>&#9;Again there are no members in the branch who were in the Falklands Campaign or in the Gulf, my two sons-in-law where, my two sons were in the Army, but neither of them was in the Gulf War or the Falklands, fortunately.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 58.01</B>&#9;Can you just repeat again……………………?</P>
<B><P>A 58.22</B>&#9;I’m the Chairman of the branch, a very small branch, we only meet once a quarter, we have about a hundred members, but I think as I said we had gone right down to 11 members when Tim Chappell resuscitated it, and built it up to about 90, and we are somewhere round a hundred now which is quite good, but sad that we can’t get all the youngsters, all the servicemen in the village.  There must be another couple of hundred ex-servicemen in the village, but again they look at it as an old man’s organisation and they don’t want to be in an old man’s organisation.  They look askance at the walk down from the church to the Memorial.  I can understand what they are thinking really, but I am glad that we have got about a dozen who do it, because it does keep the Legion in the public eye and this is vital of course, if we are going to raise funds to care for those who have been injured etc etc.  </P>

<B><P>Q 59.43</B>&#9;You’ve got a very handsome house here</P>
<B><P>A 59.47</B>&#9;That’s right, it was the house that brought us to South Cerney.  I was going to be 57 when I left the Army, and it was in 1985 we came to look at the house and unemployment was savage at the time, and people were not holding on to their jobs and I faced the thought of going out to life on the dole and I didn’t fancy that one bit and when I saw this advertised and having heard that people who’d been to South Cerney said what a beautiful place it was I decided I would come over from Germany to have a look at it.  Had our 2 daughters with us and they said go for it.  I didn’t need prompting really because it meant being an 8 bedroom house we could do bed and breakfast, which would pay my mortgage of course and give me something to do more importantly.  And that is it, we do bed and breakfast, we are not terribly professional at it, inasmuch as we frequently put a notice on the door saying sorry no vacancies when we want time off. And now we are gradually withdrawing from it, but it has been an excellent way to make a living.  You really meet some excellent people, I could count on the fingers of one hand the number I wouldn’t have back in the house, out of the thousands probably who have stayed here, they really have been super.  Nice people to talk to, nice people to look after, plus the fact that they paid my mortgage.  </P>

<LI>It was at a time when the Army started to sell of some of their surplus married quarters and they gave preference to servicemen.  When I say Army, I should say Ministry of Defence really, the Army, Navy and Air Force were all covered by the same scheme, they gave preference to servicemen and in fact we got a discount off the price too along the lines of council house tenants getting discount, except that we didn’t get as much discount as they get, but still it was worth having, I thing it was about 30% discount.  I saw this in the Ministry of Defence publication which advertised surplus houses, and when I saw the house I realised it was the Station Commander’s residence.  It was built for the RAF, because this was a Royal Air Force Station at South Cerney, and when I say Station Commander, I believe he commanded Kemble and Fairford as well as RAF South Cerney, and that’s why he had such a large house because he did a lot of entertaining.  When we moved in, sadly our first winter we had a car go through the fence at the top of the garden and knocked the fence down.  I think the driver was all right, it was a bunch of Royal Agricultural Students and they all crawled out through the rear window apparently, anyway I had to get someone in to give an estimate to repair the fence, and talking to this chap, he said I know this house very well, I was born in the married quarters over there.  I said you tell me, I am going to do bed and breakfast, did anybody famous stay here like Eisenhower, because he as the Commander in Chief of all the combined allied forces during the war, and of course Americans staying here would like to hear that Eisenhower stayed here.  He said I don’t know about that but I’ll tell you who did stay, Winston Churchill. I said that’s better still, so we have a room up here, the main room, which we refer to as the Churchill room.  How he knew that Churchill had stayed here was, his father was in the RAF at the time, and he was working out here in the field and they apparently had wooden huts here at that stage, and whatever he was doing, working in the area, he saw Winston Churchill come out of this glass door behind us, and walk down the path, there was a gate at the bottom and he was carrying his case and smoking his inevitable cigar, and this chap’s father saw that he was going to throw the cigar away any minute and he followed him down the road and Churchill did throw the cigar away then ground it out with his cane so the old man didn’t get his cigar.  He wasn’t after the souvenir; he was after the smoke, because during the war you couldn’t get a cigar or course.  He said my dad still tells that tale now.  I didn’t have the gumption to get his dad’s name and it is part of the history of the house.  Just like the camouflage paint on the outside there if you can see it, as I say I should have.</LI></OL>

<B><P>04.08&#9;</B>We had a chap doing a job here, and I was asking him did he know of anyone famous who had stayed here, and he said well no, in fact I had mentioned Eisenhower, he said I don’t know about that, but I’ll tell you who did stay, Winston Churchill, which was far far better in my eyes as an Englishman.  And he told we that his father had been working out in the field over there where they wooden huts and he saw Winston Churchill come out of this glass door behind us, and walk down the path, there was a gate at the bottom and he was carrying his case and smoking his inevitable cigar, and his father fancied the cigar, because he could see he was going to throw it away and minute, he wanted a smoke not a souvenir, and he followed Winston all the way round, he did throw the cigar away then ground it out with his cane and poor old lad didn’t get the cigar, the smoke he was gasping for, and according to this chap his father still tells the tale, but stupidly I didn’t get his name to make it part of the history of the house.  I told this story to Ted the barber, a couple of years after I think, and then the next time I went into Ted’s shop, he said do you know who else stayed in your house, and I said no, and he said Queen Mary stayed thee, wife of George V, now according to Ted, who had got it from someone else in the village, Jim Bateman I think, now Jim Bateman was the batman here for 31 years, and I think Jim told Ted that Queen Mary was living over at Badminton with the Duke of wherever, and it was a sort of vague story that there was some threat against her, maybe the thought of being kidnapped or something by German paratroops coming in, so they evacuated her from there to here because this was secure.  I can’t vouch for the accuracy of the story, but that is what Ted the barber told me, presumably as I say, given my Jim Bateman who lives down in Berkeley Close.</P>

<B><P>A 06.58</B>&#9;Now I told Ted about the Winston Churchill visit, this is Ted the barber down in the village, and that next time I went into Ted’s shop, he told me that Jim Bateman had been in and told him that another visitor had been Queen Mary, and apparently Queen Mary had been evacuated from London down to Badminton to stay with the Duke of Beaufort, and there had been some threat or some perceived threat against her, presumably the Intelligence forces had been at work and so she was evacuated from there, from Badminton over here, this being a secure area of course.  I think she stayed 3 or 4 days, I can’t vouch for the accuracy of the story as I got it third hand, but I thought it was very interesting, and Queen Mary probably stayed in my Churchill room.</P>
