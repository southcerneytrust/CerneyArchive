<B><P>Q 32.16</B> &#9;Tell me were you born in Cerney Wick?</P>




<B><P>A 32.32 –C</B>&#9;South Cerney at Quercus which is still standing, next to the old railway line&#9;</P>

<B><P>Q 32.32</B>&#9;And you?</P>
<B><P>A 32.34 -J</B>&#9;I was born in Cheltenham.  My father became policeman in South Cerney in 1934, so I was six years old when we moved to South Cerney.</P>

<B><P>Q 32.51</B>&#9;Tell me about your education, did you both go to Ann Edwards?</P>
<B><P>A 32.56 –C</B> &#9;Yes I went to Ann Edwards in School Lane, and from there went to Cirencester Grammar School.</P>
<B><P>A 33.04 –J</B>&#9;We went to Cirencester Grammar School together and to Ann Edwards together.</P>

<B><P>Q 33.15</B>&#9;How did the school strike you…………………..?</P>
<B><P>A 33.19 –C</B>&#9;The Primary? I thought it was excellent.  I started when I was 4 with Mr Riggall, and it was still Mr Riggall when I left and went to the Grammar School and yes it was a good solid foundation.  The education system was good, I’m not so sure that learning by rote isn’t a good idea because what I learned, I certainly haven’t forgotten tables.  I’ve never learned how to use a computer and I don’t particularly want to now, although that’s a bit narrow-minded I expect. </P>

<B><P>Q 34.17</B>&#9;Can you remember anything about the building?</P>
<B><P>A 34.20 –C</B>&#9;Well there were only 2 classrooms and the toilets outside, not much other than there were 2 classrooms in the playground.  I remember the name of the person that I went to was a Miss Kerslake and then I went to Miss Dunn, and strangely, she was still teaching when my children went to Ann Edwards School, so there was quite a follow on.  They were happy days.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 35.05</B>&#9;Did you play a lot in the fields and……….?</P>
<B><P>A 35.08 –C</B>&#9;Oh yes, there was nothing to fear.  I would run home and get into my swimming costume and go across the meadows to the white wharves which were over the railway bridge, down Wilmer Lane, and across Moor fields to the white wharves where I would lift stones and catch crayfish.  I would go on my own and my mother wouldn’t have second thoughts about it.  There were no fears, it was a wonderful freedom for children </P>

<B><P>Q</B> <B>35.50</B>&#9;Were they any flowers and things?</P>
<B><P>A 35.52 –C&#9;</B>Many wild flowers.  The thing I hear most, when I sit hear and hear the pigeons, well doves now, it always seemed to be hot in summer and you could go across the fields and hear these pigeons and bees, bumble bees, the thing I think I miss most is when the moon daisies where out, there was quaking grass which I have searched for an can’t find anymore.  Lots of wildlife.</P>

<B><P>Q 36.36</B>&#9;Was the canal……………….?</P>
<B><P>A 36.40 –C</B>&#9;I would think pretty much as it is now actually, it ceased to function years before, I think it was pretty much the same as it is now. There were footpaths across the fields which I think a lot of them have been eroded, and a lot of the walks have disappeared.  You cold go across the fields and the farmers didn’t mind, there seemed to be a track formed by people walking and people tended to keep to that track and we would walk.  I had a profoundly handicapped brother who fortunately or unfortunately died when I was 8, until that time of course my mum had to give most of her attention to him, well all of her attention to him, so I spent a lot of time with my grandmother who was a charming old lady and gave me no end of care and attention and I have great fond memories of her.  After my brother died we used to go out as a family for walks across and down Wilmer, past Wilmer House to what is now the A419 to the halfway house, Horse and Groom and then walk back along Bow Wow and back to the railway bridge there and back along the railway line home.  Very happy memories of long walks in the country.</P>

<B><P>Q 38.36</B>&#9;Do you remember seeing Cynthia when you were young and at school?</P>
<B><P>A 38.38 –J</B>&#9;Yes, as I say we went to Ann Edwards together and we went to the Grammar School together.  The Grammar School in those days was separated the boys and the girls, but yes I remember back to those days.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 39.04</B>&#9;Can you tell us when you both came to Cerney Wick?</P>
<B><P>A 39.09 –J</B>&#9;We were married in 1950, I was working in Swindon as I left school I took and engineering apprenticeship, and we married in 1950, I went to live in a caravan in Swindon on a site which is now the Pressed Steel factory it was then a farm. We moved to Cerney Wick in 1953, when we bought this property.  It was very outdated as a property although there was no mains water, electric light had just been laid on, there was no sewerage and still is no sewerage of course, but there was no mains water until probably 2 years after we came here, so we were drawing well water from two wells, and the main well was down the bottom of the garden, so we had to walk and let the bucket down into the well and bring the water in.  There was no drainage system, except for a piece of equipment, there was a table with a hole in the middle with an enamel bowl in, and you carried outside to empty in out on the garden.  We soon did something about putting some form of draining in the kitchen and I don’t know how many years later we put in a bathroom.  Three years after we came here we put in a bathroom and a septic tank system in when we could afford it.  And we’ve gradually moved on from there, having originally set out a five year plan I’ve still not completed it yet, still some little bits and pieces to do, and God willing maybe we'll have time to do them.    </P>

<B><P>Q 41.39</B>&#9;How many children have you brought up here?</P>
<B><P>A 41.41 – J</B>&#9;Six.  4 boys, 2 girls.  The eldest ones went to the Grammar School, then the Grammar School was closed down when the comprehensive system came in and so the rest of them went through one of the comprehensive School in Cirencester.</P>

<B><P>Q 42.08</B>&#9;How has the village changed in your time?</P>
<B><P>A 42.14 –J</B>&#9;When we came here of course, it was very much a farming community with 3 active farms with milking herds, so one of the things you got as you walked down the road was a dirty road, from where the cows had been up and down it twice a day.  There were also problems with the drainage system into the Thames, the village would flood every winter and you would have water running down through the village.  Until eventually the Thames Water Board, or whatever it was called in those days, sorted out the problem to allow the problem to get away.  The ditch was an open ditch, which apparently belonged to the householders inasmuch as we had letters from the Council every year saying please clean out your ditch, and one day they decided to come and pipe it, which I didn’t really object to, but from thereon the ditch has been part of our property.  I suppose a lot of the village has centred round the pub; there has never been a shop, well since we’ve been here there hasn’t been a shop, prior to that there was something that you might have called a shop inasmuch as there was house with a window that used to have things on display and you could buy a few sweets and things.  The village hall was still very active, there was a village hall committee, still is, except I think it’s now called the village committee, and we did repair work on the village hall, and of course during the war, there was quite a bit of money raised towards a new village hall, because a plot of land had been allocated some years back to built a new hall, we had even reached the stage of having plans drawn up, a pictorial view of the new village hall complete with stage and dressing room, but that’s as far as it got.  The village hall itself was said to have been put in position not long after the First World War, it was a prefabricated wooden construction building which had been used in the war, it was transported here and erected.  It is still in position.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 45.10</B>&#9;How does the church fit into the village?</P>
<B><P>A 45.15 –C</B>&#9;It was very active some years back, more active than it is today unfortunately.  there used to be a choir and quite a good choir, which I’m sure will be confirmed.  Mrs Rimes was organist for many years, in fact she was the church when we first came here, she did the cleaning, there was an old solid fuel stove at the back of the church that she would fuel and fire and keep lovely and warm, there was carpet or matting, right from the door to the alter, which she used to have up and beat.  She was the sacristan, as I say she was the church.  She played the organ as well, but as time goes by one ages, and it wasn’t in her day that the choir existed, it was at a later date when Raymond became the organist.  We had a very lively choir and choir robes in the time of Mrs Jackson.  It was a very lively and go-ahead church at that time.  Sadly I think it’s like a lot of churches, it’s not as used as it might be at the moment.  It was re-roofed about 30 years ago I should think by Berkeleys.  We raised a lot of money then to put a new roof on the church.  It was a good community then and we all worked together. We had sales in South Cerney in aid of the church roof, and I think it was somewhere in the region of £2,000 to have the roof done, and very much enjoyed it actually.  We worked hard for it.  Going on from when John was talking about when we first came to the village; the great difference I find is that when we came here we had three different milkman that came into the village, there were four different butchers, and people such as International Stores, Gibbons from Ashton Keynes, Co-op from Cricklade and latterly the Spar shop which was, Mr and Mrs Bateman, it wasn’t where it is now, but where the wine shop is to be found in South Cerney now.  They would actually come round and knock on your door and say is there anything you require this week, would take an order and would deliver it.  There was a baker everyday of the week.  The only thing left is a milkman every other day, 3 times a week that is all we have left in the way of deliveries.  The daily paper used to be delivered and there used to be a Sunday paper. Now if we need a paper we go to South Cerney to collect one.  This is one of the differences.  The other difference I find with Cerney Wick is that of course the gravel pits hadn’t been started and there were many lovely walks across the fields and authentic ones, not encroaching on land, not trespassing, and I must confess that I was horrified when I was cycling to see my mother in South Cerney one day to see this huge machine taking the top soil off what is now the Cotswold Sailing Club and there was a bridle track which goes along the back lane and it went out down there, and I think probably it was the route from Ashton Keynes to South Cerney, because the railway station at South  Cerney used to be known as the Ashton Keynes and South Cerney Railway Station, and I think that may have been the direct route from Ashton Keynes at it came out up by the Cotswold Sailing Club.  They were taking the topsoil of with this huge machine, and I threw my bicycle down and strode across the field and shouted at him to stop, I said you can’t do this, and he said sorry but I’ve been given my instructions, so I went to Alice Mary Hadfield and complained.  She assured me there would be the most wonderful walks around the perimeters of all the lakes, but I’m sorry to say that a lot of them have become private, keep out, no dogs, and where the footpaths used to be we cannot walk there, it’s just water now, there is no way, and I find that extremely sad.</P>

<B><P>Q 51.22</B>&#9;It seems odd to me that having had the licence to take the gravel that the land doesn’t come back…..?</P>
<B><P>A 51.33 –C</B>&#9;It’s not reclaimed. They don’t infill and in actual fact one of the first pieces of land to be gravelled in South Cerney, and that was before my time, was done by Mr Whiting, who I believe built Quercus, because behind Quercus, where I was born, was an active saw mill and was active for quite a long time when I was a little girl, and one of the first fields to be gravelled was done by wheelbarrow I believe and a spade, and that was opposite where my uncle, Horace Gough, lives now, which is now known as Kingfisher Place.  In any case, Mr Whiting was all for replacing the land as he had found it, so it was infilled again after they had taken out the gravel by horse and cart, it was replaced a re-seeded, so the fields were left more or less, a little bit lower, but more or less as they had been found initially.  Actually, at one stage a number of us from Cerney Wick went to Gloucester to protest, because the field where these new houses are built next door, Hills wanted to come in and gravel that.  There was Mollie Johnstone, Mrs. Morton, I think Arthur Webb, and myself; several of us went to Gloucester to put our points of view, because they either wanted to gravel or put a housing estate there.  We felt that a housing estate was totally out of keeping with the rest of the village and we certainly didn’t want a Hills’ gravel pit in the middle of the village because Hills were not very tidy work people, that’s perhaps a bit derogatory.  [<B>J</B> – I think that what they appeared to do was to open the gate and start digging inside the gateway, where other people went to the farthest end of the field and started from the back end and worked towards the gate, which normally made a much neater job of it.  [<B>C – </B>and in actually fact when they left it, they didn’t leave it very tidy anyway.  [<B>J</B> – They proposed to dig Church Piece and then give it to the village, but the village also didn’t want a disused gravel pit.  Part of Church Piece had been gravelled, again by hand, and carried to the canal, when the canal was working, so they knew there was gravel there, because a part of it is a lot lower where it has been hand gravelled and the top soil been put back on.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 54.41</B>&#9;Can you remember any of the names of the fields here?</P>
<B><P>A 54.48</B>&#9;The only one I can remember is Church Piece really.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 54.54</B>&#9;One change we haven’t talked about is the coming of the Spine Road and the difference it made to the traffic ……………….?&#9;</P>
<B><P>A 55.06 –C</B>&#9;Actually it was quite beneficial, the Spine Road, because we had until that stage gravel lorries coming through, and that was one hazard with the ditch still being open, and that was one reason I think why the ditches were filled in because on many occasions we had a lorry come along the edge of the grass, along the edge of the ditch and topple over against our wall.  It was beneficial in that respect that the lorries could use that road instead.  [<B>J</B> – And the Spine Road was built initially to take the gravel out and it was built by the gravel people.  Cullimore’s built part of it and one of the other companies built the other part.  They didn’t make a very good job if it, because the foundations are going, as you probably noticed as you drive along the Spine Road, it is pretty bumpy.  Heavy transport drove along it, but really it’s the foundations that have gone in the bottom.  [<B>C</B>- But there again I thing, with having, and I know it’s progress, but progress seems to comes much too rapidly, and with the Spine Road we lost a lot of meadows, and flora and fauna a feel.  The butterflies, also the wildlife, I think so much of it has disappeared with progress.  [<B>J</B> – You could walk from here to South Cerney without seeing a road if you went across the fields and you come out where the railway bridge is at Wilmer Lane, from Wilmer Lane you could walk right up, going across the fields and this end and right the way across.  Of course now, you have to stop and walk across the Spine Road and a lot of the footpaths have disappeared anyway.</P>
<P>&#9;[<B>C</B> – Very nostalgic, because when I was a child, my father worked at the Creamery, he had a coal business in South Cerney, and it was early 30’s and not a very good time to be in business, and there was Bill Maidment, who had a coal business at the same time, and they both went in the same direction and that was down.  He had to get a job so he worked for BP for a time and then went to work at the Creamery and so we accorded free milk as part of the wage I suppose, so on my little bicycle I would come daily to the Creamery with a can on the handlebars to collect the milk and the lane then had grass growing in the middle of it and I can always remember cycling down Cerney Wick lane and coming through Cerney Wick obviously and the trees made the most beautiful archway all the way down, all the old trees, beautiful. It was so peaceful, it’s so fast now, there were no cars, very few cars, but the other things about Cerney Wick is the neighbourliness, the friendliness, it’s not quite the same as it used to be, and when we came here, as John said, the village hall was very much in use, we had whist drives every Tuesday night, we had a Women’s Institute, every year we raised money for the children at Christmas, we had a bus load go to the pantomime at Bristol and in the summer we had another free outing, I say free because we had raised the money, we would have various sales of work, we also had a very active flower show in the summer here, and races for the children and parents it was a very active village and everyone pulled together and did things together and we worked really altogether, there was no animosity, no bickering, or if there was I never knew of it.  <B>[J</B> – I think there might have been the suggestion that you are not really part of the community in detail until you’ve been here 20 years, because a lot of the people have been born in the village or born very locally, and known in the village.  I suppose we were known to a certain extent, but people who came from outside, and not many did in those days, were probably seen as well, it takes 20 years before you become part of the furniture.  Now of course the majority of people come in from the outside fairly recently.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 60.29</B>&#9;You mentioned a smock do you remember anybody…………………?</P>
<B><P>A 60.36 -C</B>&#9;It came from Mr Smart who used to run the Crown, and Mr Smart was the late Mrs Rimes’ father, Mrs Chapman’s grandfather, and more recently Mrs Diana Rimes’ parents run the pub, and they apparently found it there and she gave it to my children, Mrs Giles gave it to my children to dress up in and I wouldn’t let them have it because it was so antique even then, because apparently, I would think, Mrs Chapman’s grandmother had made this smock, it was all hand sewn, hand smocked most beautifully all the seams were feather stitched together. I’m sorry to say we loaned it to someone and is hasn’t been returned.</P>

<B><P>Q 61.48</B>&#9;One of the things I managed to dig out of the record ………..? are the folksongs that were sung earlier this century around here somewhere, do you remember any of the singers?</P>
<B><P>A 62.06 –C</B>&#9;No that was before our time.  I do remember the last war and every week there was a whist drive and dance in the village hall to raise funds for the forces and it’s a wooden construction and there was a blind pianist called Robin Howse who used to come from Latton to play the music for the dance, and there again it was a wonderful community spirit.  Down Ampney was an RAF base, with masses of soldiers and it would reverberate with laughter and song and wonderful and no one was frightened to cycle alone from South Cerney to Cerney Wick.  [J – Looking back on those days, and Cynthia probably knows more about this than me, that although there were a lot of servicemen around there were never and fears of girls getting into any sorts of problems.  They’d have fun and laughter and dance and go home.  They used to also have dances in South Cerney village hall, and I can remember probably not many days before D-Day, when the airborne troops were around and I can also remember one man eating razor blades one day, one of the airman, and chewing the saucer of a cup, I don’t know really what that meant, but those are the sort of things that stay in your mind.  As I look back on the war years, when I was initially in the Police Station in South Cerney, and incidentally I suppose everybody has told you that you don’t belong to South Cerney until you have fallen in the ditch, as one of the features.  I remember my father as a policeman and that was an open ditch outside the police house where it is now, he’d fallen in the ditch while walking out there in the dark one night and tripping, and most people have and I know Cynthia has fallen in the ditch as well so she’s …..(?)  But some of the things that stand out about the wartime, and my father had retired just before the war and moved two doors away to Stowell, to the little bungalow, two doors from the police station and I can remember when the bombs dropped in Cerney Wick very close to the round house, just outside the round house, just in the middle of the canal, and I can remember it was about 8.30, 9 o’clock at night and you could hear this plane coming over and you could hear the whistle of the bomb coming down, and I was outside at Stowell, and by the time the bomb came down I was indoors under the living room table.  The bomb went off in the middle of the canal, it blew the windows out of the church, it blew roofs of houses, but it didn’t touch the round house, the round house being round, the blast seemed to go round it and it didn’t make a mark on the round house at all.  [<B>C</B> – With regard to the church, when the bomb dropped the east window had stained glass in it and it was shattered and I have always believed that the remnants that were any use were taken to South Cerney by the historical society to be replaced at a later date.  I don’t know whatever happened to them, we have never had it replaced.  I don’t know where they ended up or if they found they were no good in the end, but I think it has been discussed quite recently, when an architect came to look at the church, as to what had happened to the stained glass window, I think the question was raised, so there is no stained glass, only a tiny bit, if that, left now, so that was very sad. </P>

<B><P>Q 66.49</B>&#9;Can I go back to talk about the Police Station, tell me what …….?</P>
<B><P>A 67.04 –J</B>&#9;Well first of all my grandfather had been a policeman, he’d been policeman at Northleach and Stow on the Wold, in fact he was the last police sergeant at Northleach when it was a prison.  And my father therefore followed in his footsteps and joined the police force.  There was then the outbreak of war, and he went into the Gloucester Hussars and was in Palestine for the duration of the 14-18 War, then he came back to the police force.  He was in Mitcheldene, then Cheltenham where was I born, and then Windrush and from Windrush to South Cerney, and in those days they used to move the police about every four or five years.  You’d move on to another location, and so we came to South Cerney in 1934, I remember certain things.  South Cerney Camp was just starting being built around 1935,36, and there were a lot of Irish labourers there, and I can remember he had trouble with them coming into the village and getting drunk.  A firm, Chivers of Devizes, they are still in existence did a lot of the building work.  I can remember him coming in one day and saying, we have found three men, they were all as drunk as anything; we got hold of Chivers and they brought a lorry down with two men, they let the side board down on the lorry and they threw the men up into the back of the lorry to take them back to up to their quarters at the Camp.  I suppose in those days of course the only way he was mobile was on a bicycle, and the police supplied a bicycle.  My father was quite tall and it was a bicycle with double bars on it I remember, a BSA bicycle.  They used to have to ride and leave tickets at certain locations, big houses normally with the next area, places like Down Ampney; he’d have to go leave a ticket and collect a ticket where the policeman from Ampney Crucis had left a ticket there so you got the overlap, as an insurance that you had visited that area.</P>

<B><P>Q 69.40</B>&#9;What were the worst sort of crimes…………..?</P>
<B><P>69.42 – J</B>&#9;When he was in Windrush he had to deal with a murder situation, but that is not South Cerney, and that was simply where somebody had been murdered, the body had been found and with the body was a box of sandwiches.  I think they were salmon sandwiches, and they advertised on the radio for anyone who had made salmon sandwiches that morning to find out who the person was, and that was how they identified the person.  One of his main occupations was moving young men off the bridge in the middle of the village, because the bridge was quite narrow, there was no footpath and there were a lot of gravel lorries around and the men used to congregate on the top of the bridge and whenever they saw PC Parsloe coming up they all scattered, and many of the men like Freddy Maidment, used to tell me when Fred was alive, I remember your father chasing us off.  My grandfather, I know this doesn’t affect South Cerney at all and this is going a bit farther back, but he used to carry a little stick around with him and he would wallop anybody with it, there was no problem at all that was part of the feature and I’ve recently got a book that gives an outline of that, written around Stow on the Wold.  The other think that I remember, on his desk I suppose there were handcuffs, there was a brass knuckle-duster, not used, not that the handcuffs were used very often.  In the cupboard there was a whole stack of truncheons and to me as a young boy, you opened this cupboard and it was very damp on the bottom shelf of this cupboard because it was on an outside wall, and it was full of old truncheons with a leather belt on them. We had the telephone of course, and not too many people had a telephone in those days, but being the police station we had the telephone, which was liable to go off in the middle of the night and you had to go out.  You couldn’t pass in on to anyone else, you were on duty 24 hours a day.  In 1939, he had done 25 years’ service and they wanted him to stop on because the war had just started and they knew that they would need people, but he maintained that he had sufficient of police work, one thing he didn’t like was going to Gloucester on point duty, where he had to stand in the middle of the Gloucester centre and direct the traffic.  He didn’t like things like that, so he decided to retire at 45 years old on a police pension, which was £13 a month, which in those days must have been a reasonable sort of pension.  I think I’m right there as far as I can remember, that was 1939, and he retired and for a very short period he went on security at Kemble Aerodrome, but then he got a job as County Court Bailiff in Cirencester and he did that until he eventually retired completely, because he was not frightened of going round and issuing summons to people and subpoenas and what have you.  It didn‘t worry him, it was all part of his upbringing as a policeman.  I think he always thought that I was going to be a policeman as well; continuity, but ever since a young boy I had always wanted to be an engineer.  The first long word I could ever spell was engineer.  I got myself a job as an apprentice toolmaker and draftsman and that’s how I started and eventually finished, although I am working now, but in a different field.</P>

<B><P>Q 74.10</B>&#9;Did you yourself have wartime service?</P>
<B><P>A 74.12 –J</B>&#9;Yes, although I was an apprentice, and deferred for a period, and then in 1946, they were very short of people and I was called up in March 1946 and went into the Royal Engineers, by Christmas of that same year I was posted to Germany in the occupation forces and I went to Hanover. I spent the next 2 years in Germany in what they termed locations. Hanover of course was pretty flat by then, there was hardly any houses standing, just one or two odd places, the only place that was standing compete was the barracks and that is where we were located.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 75.03</B>&#9;What was the contrast in seeing the people in Germany ……?</P>
<B><P>A 75.07</B>&#9;It was not very pleasant, people were living on allotments, in old allotment huts, in corrugated iron huts and some of the people were living in cellars that still existed. I became in charge of a group of German drivers and lorries to collect timber from German sawmills that had been requisitioned for transport back to this country, and so I had about 12 – 14 German ex-soldiers working for me.  It was a fairly quick way of learning the basic language, very basic, but the main thing I found from talking to most people was that a lot of them had been on the Russian front and they were not very impressed with the Russians, and they were very pleased to get into the English and the American zones, and they we quite reasonable type of men.  It was a very bad winter in 1947 in this country and it was in Germany as well.  I can remember getting stuck in snowdrift many times.  Very glad to get back out of the Army and get back to my apprenticeship, which I managed to do with the help of the then head of Swindon College, who I came home to see, and I told him I needed a letter to say that I needed to get back to my education and just told me to dictate it to his secretary and he would sign it.  And that got me out of the Army really because they wanted to defer and they wanted people to stop on longer, so I got out by September 1948.</P>

<B><P>Q 77.09</B>&#9;You weren’t involved with the Korean war?</P>
<B><P>A 77.12</B>&#9;No.  This was the German occupation.</P>

<B><P>Q 77.20</B>&#9;What happened when you got your apprenticeship finished?</P>
<B><P>A 77.23</B>&#9;I continued to work for the same firm, I progressed from being a toolmaker to a draftsman, and from a draftsman to a production engineer; a production manager and so on.  Until eventually I came to the retirement age.  I then decided to start as a consultant, which I am still operating on about 4 days a month for other companies.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>77.56 –C</B>&#9;Ages, one tends to look back at the good things in life, perhaps that’s a bit sad, perhaps you should be looking forward instead of stagnating or regressing, but I have very fond memories of Cerney Wick when the children were growing up and it was hard.  My daughter said to me the other day, my youngest, there was a ten year gap between my youngest and the next one, and how much he has been spoilt and whereas they were allowed one chocolate biscuit per week when the baker came on a Friday, he would just ask for biscuits and he would get them, and it hasn’t done him as much good as the older ones.  It made them much more appreciative, which I think is sad.  I think the youngsters today are not appreciative enough of the fineries.  When we came here we had virtually nothing, we bought the place from a Mr and Mrs Burton, and as John has said the kitchen was very small with a little scrub table with a bowl in the middle, in which I had to do all the washing and walk to the wash house and boil it.  We had virtually nothing, and we built it up from there, but no young wife would come into what I came into then, I’m sure.  We darkened the floorboards and we put down congoleum squares, and I can hear people saying what is a congoleum square?  It was the epitome of luxury, and four of the children were born here with the local midwife and that’s another sad aspect that’s gone by the board, there is no local nurse now. No local district nurse, who was a friend, who lived in South Cerney in the Leaze, but before that I believe it was in Upper Up, and she was a true friend of the community.  There are lots of aspects that have gone by the board.</P>

<B><P>Q 80.30</B>&#9;Did the children ever suffer from anything like quinsy or anything like that?</P>
<B><P>A 80.34 –C</B>&#9;The children didn’t have quinsy, I did.  They had mumps measles, all the childhood complaints really.  Nothing seriously wrong.  We’re very fortunate.  Having had a handicapped brother I do understand how lucky I have been to have these children that have all been so healthy, and when I got to the ripe age of 50, and Matthew was then about 7, the doctor advised me to go back to work and having been a secretary, I decided that if I went into a school to work I would get school holidays and be home with my son who was 7 and the others were adults, in fact my grandson is the same age as my son, my younger son, so I applied for administrative clerk, they never called them secretaries in schools because they had to pay them more.  I was appointed to Paternoster School for 8 hours per week, and I stayed there 11 years, but it did become 25 hours per week in the end.  At the age of 61 I decided to retire, because they were going to become computersied and that would mean that I would have to travel to Gloucester 3 times a week to learn the system, and at that age I didn’t want to travel to learn computing, and by the time I had learned it would have been time to retire anyway, so I thought the time had come to retire, but it worked wonders for me going into that school.  I really missed it, I still miss it.  I miss the children, they were lovely kids, and there is a moral.  Paternoster School is in Watermoor Road in Cirencester, it used to be part of the Health Authority.  There was a centre in Stroud, then they decided that they should open one in Cirencester, so part of the clinic was given to the Education Department and the clinic was next door, which was very helpful, because the health visitors were always on hand if we needed any expert advice and the medical officer for health would visit frequently. But its gone full circle really, because I was invited quite recently to go back, and now the clinic has become part of Paternoster School, so the Education has now taken over the Health Authority part, whereas originally Paternoster School was allocated part of the Health, part of the clinic, so it has gone full circle.  They now have a hydrotherapy pool, which is very advantageous to the physically handicapped and they have a large nursery unit for under 5’s with problems.  It’s very rewarding work.</P>
<B>
<P>85.28 –J&#9;</B>One thing I said many years ago that Cerney Wick will end up one day with double yellow lines through it and I imagine what goes with that is antique shops or cafes with the advent of the Water Park, and when I look back to when I was a small boy, the Reverend Kennon was the vicar at South Cerney, he always used to forecast that this would become another large holiday centre, and that is when they first started commercially digging gravel.  He could foresee the future and he was dead right.</P>
<B><P>&#9;[C –</B> John always used to say that this would be a second Cheddar Gorge one day and I used to ridicule him, I can see it happening, the cars parked on the road is horrendous at times.  If ever there was a fire or anything serious, I wonder if the fire engine would be able to get through, because the jams on the roads and the traffic and it is nice to come through little villages and see little villages, you don’t always want to keep to the motorways, it is nice to diverse and see how the other half live in different communities, but it has become worse.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 86.54</B>&#9;Inaudible question about new bypass.</P>
<B><P>A 87.09</B> <B>-J</B>&#9;Yes we’ve got a man coming to see us this afternoon about compensation.   I think that they made a mistake in the position of the bypass because they had 3 or 4 alternative routes initially and what they were unable to forecast was the Creamery was going to close, because looking at it now they could have gone straight through the middle of the Creamery which would have been a lot cheaper and a lot straighter and taken it away from Cerney Wick anyway.  As you know one of the main objections at the moment is the material they used to lay the road.  I was completely unaware that it was going to be laid that way, I think some other people knew about it, but it certainly I don’t think was broadcast very well that they were going to put in a concrete surface, and we have objected to that, we are still objecting to that and requesting that they put tarmac on the top to cut down the noise. [<B>C</B> – apart from the noise it is very beneficial because it has taken all the heavy traffic away from the old 419, from the M4 to the M5.  It is beneficial for heavy traffic, but it certainly depends on which quarter the wind is for the noise factor.  John has said that someone was coming this afternoon, I wish he had come to visit when the wind was in the north east.  It is almost 90% worse when the wind is coming from that quarter.  I’m out in the garden quite often and when the wind is coming from the south west, I can live with it, but I pity the people from Down Ampney when it’s in a south westerly direction.  [<B>J</B> – And certain people in Latton are closer still, but nevertheless at Latton they’ve always had it, because first it used to go past the front door and now it goes past the back door. [<B>C</B> - But I do think really it’s like Fairford Aerodrome, we have the International Air Display and by the end of the second day one is becoming accustomed to the extra noise, and I think given time, people will become accustomed and used to the noise level.  Certainly I’m against the amount of traffic inasmuch as, we have cars, we have one each, I used to walk to South Cerney, I only learned to drive when I was expecting my last child at 43. It has made me very lazy, I used to cycle or walk to South Cerney, 3 times a week at least.  Now of course it’s much easier to pop in the car and it’s not very good healthwise.  </P>

<B><P>00.02 – J</B>&#9;When I first started work as an apprentice in Swindon, I initially took lodgings in Swindon and then didn’t like that very much and decided to live in South Cerney and travel by train.  So I travelled on the 7 o’clock workmen’s train from Cerney Station which took me to Old Town, and from Old Town you get on to another train that goes round the loop at  Rushy Platt(?)  Down to the main Swindon Station and then catch the bus to Kembrey Street where I worked, and return of that, we didn’t finish work in those days until 6 o’clock, so we didn’t et home very early.  But I still sometimes walk down the old railway line, where the railway line used to be, and think, well I wonder if that tree was there when we used to go past, and there are still relics of where the telegraph poles used to be down the railway line.  [<B>C</B> – Margaret Webb’s father used to be signalman, and taking me back to my very young days, I spent many happy hours with him in his signal box and Mr Barnfield was the other signalman, and they used to let me press the buttons to release the tablet and go out with them to give the tablet to the train driver, and Mr Bowden was the Station Master and in the waiting room there was always the most wonderful fire, and he would let me punch the tickets in his machine, I would play for hours in the waiting room, and I was never turned away never.  There used to be allotments over the other side of the railway station where I believe there is now a very nice bungalow, but a lot of; my father, my uncle, my grandfather, the signalman, lots of people had allotments there, and what we called the ballast whole, obviously it had been dug for ballast, the fishing club used to use that for fishing, it’s all very nostalgic.</P>

<B><P>Q 02.38</B>&#9;Did you sometimes used to go into the cinema………..?</P>
<B><P>A 02.45 -C</B>&#9;I was never a cinema fan I’m afraid.  I do remember the express train from Southampton being stopped, because my father originated from Chester, so the main express would be stopped for us to board at South Cerney to go through to Crewe, because it was mainline from Southampton to Crewe, and we would get on to go to Crewe to change to go to Chester to visit my paternal grandparents.  </P>

<B><P>Q 03.20</B>&#9;Do you remember a lady in 1937 making a film?</P>
<B><P>A 03.25 -C</B>&#9;Yes I do I very slightly remember; I was only saying the other day, I think I must have been on that film because she took the school children coming out of the playground and going towards the village hall and I remember all this happening down school lane, and film crews there for about a week, I think they were, but very vaguely, nothing particularly.</P>

<P>05.10 –C&#9;</B>I remember my mother telling me when she was a child how she had to curtsey to the vicar and how she had to curtsey to the widows who lived at the college; they always had to curtsey and show the greatest reverence to them.  I know Miss Hall who lived at the College, she used to teach art, and my mother used to talk about her, she was art teacher at the Grammar School.  My mother was sent to work in Ireland at the age of 12, and when my uncle, Horace Gough, was born, she had to come back from Ireland at the ripe age of 14, to look after her mother and the younger children.  I can’t really envisage a child these days at 14 being sent all the way to Ireland to work, with a cabin trunk on their own.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 06.18</B>&#9;Was your mother trained for service by the ladies of the College……..?</P>
<B><P>A 06.23 -C</B>&#9;No I don’t think so. I think she was just sent out to get some money, because my grandfather believed in hard work.  He was a rabbit trapper, if you speak to my uncle he will tell you, and he worked in various places throughout the country.  There was a lot spoken against the trapping and he went and spoke in the House of Lords about it, he put his case.  He was a very forceful character.  He never thought too kindly of Captain Cripps, they always seemed to be at loggerheads, until my grandfather was dying, and Captain Cripps came to visit him, and afterwards my grandfather said I never realised he was such a gentleman.  And really if you had known my grandfather, you would have known what that meant.  </P>

<B><P>Q 07.39</B>&#9;Tell us a bit more about your grandmother………..?</P>
<B><P>A 07.43 –C</B>&#9;She was a very important person in my life.  I feel sad to say this, but my brother was normal until he was 5 and then he became ill, and they didn’t know what was wrong with him so they took him to Cheltenham Hospital where they operated on every nerve in his body.  Consequently he was, as my mother tells, me, because he would have been 85 now, he was the oldest, I was the youngest.  My mother had 5 children, of which I was the only survivor, and times were very hard, the doctors didn’t even have transport, pony and trap, my mother told me that one little girl was born with a tumour on the brain and died at about 3 months. One choked to death, and the eldest, Raymond, he was admitted into Cheltenham and they operated on every nerve in his body and he came back a total cripple, and was never able to walk or speak again and in turned out that it was infantile paralysis.  They had no idea of what it had been, so he grew to be a man and it was very hard, because he fitted and couldn’t feed himself or toilet or anything, so I can understand how my mother’s total commitment was to my brother.  My grandmother only lived 2 doors away, so I would run to her everyday, and the bread was delivered everyday, always at five minutes to ten every morning.  There was always a hymn and a prayer every morning which my grandmother would sit and listen to with me, then she would say come on my dear what would you like to play today, and there was always time, and I think this is what children don’t get enough of on the whole.  One thing that does upset me, if I’m shopping, and children are pestering their mothers, all they get is shut up, be quiet, why can’t they just give them a few seconds of their time even if they are annoying them, why can’t they just turn it round to find something interesting to talk about.  That’s one thing my children always had, and that was time.  My grandmother would say get the cards out at 10 o’clock in the morning.  She taught me to play cribbage, she taught me to play dominos; my grandfather was furious, he would come in and he would shout and he would swear.  Why have you got time to sit here playing with her when you should be working?  And she was so placid, I wish I could be like my grandmother, she would totally ignore him as if he didn’t exist, and he’d carry on and carry on and he would go out and she say don’t be taking any notice of him my dear, let him get on with it.  And she would ignore him, and it hurt far more than getting into an argument.  Another thing I remember about my grandmother, he would come in grumbling, perhaps not if I was there but on another occasion, and she would just pick up a duster and go upstairs, and in the back of her wardrobe she always kept a bottle of port, long Victoria skirts, my grandmother, she died early in 1951, and underneath these skirts was the bottle of port and a wine glass and she would pour herself a glass of port and put it in the window behind the curtain and she had a Lloyd loom chair which looked out over the meadows, and he would come shouting, she would push the glass behind the curtain, I’m dusting.  So wise.  She didn’t argue.</P>

<B><P>12.11 –C</B>&#9;Over the bridge with her cows, now she had the most beautiful Jersey milk, and I would go up there as well as coming here, and she would make her own butter, and keep it down her well, and her cream.  It was beautiful.  She was a character, they had an old Austin 7, and she used to go out with Harry her husband, and she used to have a big hat tied on with a scarf.  She was a portly person such as myself and she sat up in this car and poor old Harry, he wasn’t as big as John, and they would fill the two seats in this Austin 7, which reminded me, going back to childhood, I can remember Miss Macklin, she lived at the College and she used to cycle every Sunday down to Cerney Wick church on her three wheeled cycle.   [<B>J</B> – She had a three wheeled bike, but only two wheels were ever on the ground, because one of the back ones was cocked up in the air. [<B>C</B> – and she used to have a hat with a scarf tied on to come down here to church.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 13.24</B>&#9;Did you go to Miss Hall’s at all?</P>
<B><P>A 13.30 –C</B>&#9;Yes sewing class, and Brownies, I never went into the Guides, I think it was at a time when I was going to the Grammar School, and apparently I couldn’t go free, mum had to pay £1.10s. a term for me to go and I had to cycle and she couldn’t afford the uniform as well as me going to the Grammar School, and I never went into the Guides.  Also I was learning to play the piano, but mum couldn’t afford that as well as send me to shorthand and typing classes, and she thought I was more likely to earn a living at being a shorthand typist than a pianist, so I had to pack up learning the piano, but my children all went to the same music teacher, Miss Matthews who lived at the Beeches, and my grandchildren went to the same teacher, and my grandson read music at Hull University.  He still hasn’t fulfilled his ambition because he wanted to compose, but I’m afraid he is a sign of the modern times, when he thinks if he sits down someone will come looking for him, and I keep telling him it won’t happen, you have got to get out in the world and look, but he hasn’t succeeded in composing so now he is going back to Ripon, to do teachers’ training, and he hopes to go teaching music in schools.  He starts in September for a year, he did his Masters in music and he is now doing his doctorate in Gilbert and Sullivan.  I don’t see enough of him, we sold our old piano, so I don’t hear him play as much as I’d like to.  But certainly Miss Matthews was the basis of his interest, she fired his enthusiast.  [<B>J</B> – I do joke with him and say the most famous composers are those who have passed away, and their music does not become really famous until they’re no longer with us. [<B>C</B> – and I tell him there isn’t room for another Andrew Lloyd-Webber, just yet.  </P>
<B><P>16.39 –C</B>&#9;Where Mr Dorling’s shop was, that had previously belonged to the Hicks family, and I remember old Mr and Mrs Seymour Hicks keeping that shop, and then Mr Dorling bought it from them, it was enlarged somewhat and continued in the grocery vein.  Coming over the bridge, there was Mr Luker’s, and apparently my grandfather used to live there at one stage, whether he sold it to Mr Luker, I don’t quite go back into history that far, but Mr Luker’s was a very nice shop, I remember going there frequently, my mum used to deal with him, and go in there on my way to school for a pennyworth of biscuits, and I would get 10 Marie, or 10 Petit Beurre for one penny.  Opposite there was Miss Lane’s sweet shop, which was renowned, it had all the jars of sweets around on the counter and you could have a pennyworth of sweets, all sorts of penny bars or halfpenny bars even, and I remember my friend, Doreen Hicks, we had a halfpenny, farthing each, or a penny between us and we went and bought a toffee bar and it was the old bridge then, not widened.  We couldn’t break it, between us we couldn’t break it, so I had this wonderful idea, if she stuck her teeth in one end and I stuck my teeth in the other and we both pulled we would break it and unfortunately it didn’t break, but I pulled her front tooth out with the toffee bar.  Miss Lane was in partnership with Miss Eamiss(?) who pre-deceased Miss Lane, and since we have been at Cerney Wick I have many happy memories of visiting Miss Lane in her shop.  Having chats about the old times and she used to sell bunches of flowers and fruit and make somewhat of a living from it.  Going down the street, Mrs Pike kept the chemist shop, which is now the wine shop, she came in my early teens I should think.  That then became the Spar shop after she finished and has developed into four small shops there.  Then there was the Pike House, which used to be Mrs Cook’s sweet shop which, my mother would give me a halfpenny for the church collection, and I would run as fast as my fat little legs would carry me up to Mrs Cook’s shop and would buy a farthing gobstopper and put a farthing in the collection.  My mother never knew.  Past that there was Morgan’s shop, which was also a bakehouse and general store, and I believe they even sold some sort of clothing there as well, and Mr &amp; Mrs Griffiths lived there, and that is the granddaughter of the original Mrs Morgan who used to keep the shop.  Her sons did the baking.  I can’t remember anymore shops, the shop wasn’t down Broadway Lane then.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 20.19</B>&#9;Was there a post office?</P>
<B><P>A 20.21</B>&#9;Oh yes, there was a post office for as long as I can remember run by the Johnson family, and the Co-op of course next to the post office, that was always there as I remember that belonged to the Stroud Co-operative Society, and I think Miss Lena Johnson was in charge of that for quite a number of years</P>

<B><P>Q 20.55</B>&#9;So did you have to go to Cirencester for anything?</P>
<B><P>A 20.57</B>&#9;No.  There was the butcher of course, Mr Mate kept the butcher’s shop, which was next door to the Eliot and there was the slaughterhouse there too.  Before him Mr Hewer was the butcher, so we always had meat.  There was always visiting butchers in the village as a child.  I remember Mr Woodward from Oaksey used to come in and Waltons of Cirencester used to come in on a Saturday with a van with meat, and more recently of course, Mr Jackson who used to live opposite, he had a butcher’s business in Cricklade with a Mr Saunders, and he used to go round villages.  I remember, not longer before my mother died in 1980, she thought she would have a tenderloin on Tuesday for lunch and he brought it to her on a tray and he said I’m awfully sorry Mrs Franklin, but it’s 50p, and she aid in that case you can take it back Mr Jackson, I will not pay 50p for one tenderloin, and when you think that 20 years on a tenderloin is now £5.</P>

<B><P>Q 22.33</B>&#9;……fish?</P>
<B><P>A 22.35&#9;</B>Yes, Mr Bert Price used to come round with his horse and cart and he would sell fresh fruit and fish, fresh fruit one side and fish the other, and I don’t think I’ve ever tasted kippers like Bert Price used to sell, they were beautiful. And having talked about that, I remember John was talking about his father being policeman; I don’t know whether his father was policeman when this happened, perhaps you’ve had it spoken of before.  Where Mr &amp; Mrs Rodney Gardiner live, a Miss Maidment used to live and the flooding, there used to be flooding all the way down Station Road in South Cerney, and Edgar Curtis used to deliver bread on a push bike with a basket, and he was going to deliver to my grandmother’s one day and he got through the water on his bike with wellingtons and there was a body in the ditch outside my grandfather’s property and it was Miss Maidment.  How she got in there was a complete mystery really, because she was in her nightclothes and she had floated from right from opposite the Pike House in South Cerney; she had come right the way down from there, and she must have been swept in eddies I should think, because she must have gone right the way under the roads by the cross to come out by the Police Station, to go all the way down Station Road, it was a complete mystery realy, I don’t think anyone ever decided how she came to be in the ditch or how she managed to get all the way under the road and get down that far.  But that was when the floods were quite high, but I don’t know if that’s when John’s father was policeman, I know I wasn’t very old, so I think probably it was.</P>
