<P>Q (26.35)&#9;</B>When did you first come to South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A (26.37)&#9;</B>I first came when I was a child of 4, my family were living near Reading wanted to find somewhere in good hunting country and some way away from Berkshire where my elder sister had just died and they wanted originally probably to have moved back to Leicestershire, but the opportunity arose to take the house which is now known as Atkyns manor which was the South Cerney Manor for the winter of 1921 and 22 the possibility arose because the then owner, Tim Cripps had a mild financial crisis and went off to live at Ampney park with his brother who later became Sir Frederick, with his horses his wife and his children for the winter.  And I remember as a child having a very happy time there and we'd never been in the Cotswolds before and it was our first taste of anything like Gloucestershire as a family.  My father immediately started looking for a house and found what is now Driffield Manor and what was then the Glebe House at Driffield and within 6 months we were living there keeping some contact with South Cerney but not a very great deal I remember how well we were welcomed for the four months that we were here, and I particularly remember Alice Mary Smythe as she was then who became Alice May Hadfield who was very good to a probably rather tiresome small boy and it was a very cold winter we had a lot of snow and I remember making both snowballs and snowmen in the front garden of Atkyns Manor. I also remember quite vividly sailing paper boats from the river bridge to the bridge that now runs into Chapter Manor which was the finishing post and there was keen competition between my paper boats and my elder brother's.  It was altogether a very happy time and I was delighted when we came back here some 65 years later to live.  We had been very happy at Driffield there was a lovely garden and a very nice house and in many way Driffield had become a non-community it was so small it couldn’t really support the church or a pub nor even a post office all had gone into decline and if you wanted to do anything you had to get in the car and go into Ciren it was a great relief to come to a place like South Cerney which has so many things going for it, it has the most delightful shops it has good gardening clubs for instance everything seems to go on here and it is still a vibrant community and one which we have been privileged to take part in.</P>

<B><P>Q (32.27)&#9;</B>You are concerned with South Cerney Trust now, what do you see the importance of that?</P>
<B><P>A (32.35)&#9;</B>The SCT was formed under the auspices of Charles and Alice Mary to represent the interests of the community and particularly to preserve the nature of the village. Both of them of course both keenly interested in architecture, and in the industrial past as well, and the SCT I hope has been instrumental in attempting to preserve what is good and not to interfere too much with what is constructive and modern and it’s a difficult balance sometimes to hold but SC has developed continuously over the last 1000 years and we don’t want, I don’t think, to cocoon it in its past.  And there does seem fortunately not to be any sign that that is going to happen, it is a difficult balance to hold particularly with the advent of the Water Park which so far I feel has had only a peripheral effect on the village although in my opinion it is a considerable national asset which we don’t want to interfere locally too much.  Of course wild life needs to be preserved, that is something which ought to be in the forefront of our minds but not the detriment of an interesting future which I’m sure that the Water Park will have. It has, with its new houses, brought outside blood into the village and which perhaps we don’t always appreciate too much but so far I personally feel that it has been to the benefit of the village and not its detriment.</P>

</B><LI>We have come to live in what has apparently always been called the Manor House.  Now what one can see is a Georgina structure which is dated 1766 on a plaque which faces the church. I think that there was a building, probably a Manor House here, which goes back to Elizabethan times, and the Georgian house is in fact built into the old Elizabethan house, and if one looks at it from the front one can see where the old stonework changes and you can see the outline of the Elizabethan house and it was on a considerably lower level than the existing Georgian structure, probably about 2 or 3 feet lower down as one can see when one goes in through the main door there is a well underneath the staircase and that represents the original level, and the Elizabethan house, if it was Elizabethan, it might have been earlier, was L shaped and had virtually the same facade as 2/3 of the Georgian House.  Inside the house there is an aperture where there was a window in the original house and that allows us to see where the original house was.  The Jones family I think probably were the richest family that have ever inhabited South Cerney and fortunately built a very nice structure which has stood the test of time.</LI></OL>
