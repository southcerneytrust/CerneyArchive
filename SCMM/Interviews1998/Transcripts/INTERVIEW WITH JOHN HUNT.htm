<B><P>Q 00.07</B>&#9;Were you born in South Cerney</P>
<B><P>A 00.09</B>&#9;No.</P>

<B><P>Q 00.09</B>&#9;Where did you come from?</P>
<B><P>A 00.11</B>&#9;Hinckley in Leicestershire</P>

<B><P>Q 00.12</B>&#9;When did you first come to South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 00.14</B>&#9;We first came here about 1980 to live here, and the surgery was started in 1977.  </P>

<B><P>Q 00.48</B>&#9;Have the numbers grown?</P>
<B><P>A 00.49</B>&#9;Enormously, not only has the population of South Cerney almost trebled since we started the surgery, but the numbers of patients have gone beyond all expectation, and I’ve got help now, another dentist does a day and a hygienist does and day and a half and we are busy the whole time.</P>

<B><P>Q 01.15</B>&#9;Did you have children growing up here?</P>
<B><P>A 01.18</B>&#9;Our 2 children grew up in Tetbury in their early days, they were born in Malmesbury, and have lived in South Cerney and went to the local schools here and have now. one has just got a degree and the other has just finished her A levels.  </P>

<B><P>Q 01.38</B>&#9;Do you think it is a good place to bring up children?</P>
<B><P>A 01.39</B>&#9;Excellent, yes lovely.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 01 44</B>&#9;You’ve been very fundamental in starting up the village appraisal, can you tell me how many people answered the questions and how the questionnaire was set up?</P>
<B><P>A 02.19</B>&#9;I was first approached about the village appraisal in December 1996.  A group of 16 people had an initial meeting in that month with the idea of  forming the village appraisal, we were all concerned about how the village was going in relation to housing, schooling, traffic increase, dog fouling, various issues that were a worry to us all and we felt that a village appraisal was the best thing at this time to actually establish the views and thoughts of the villagers.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 03.02</B>&#9;Did you have advice on this ………………………?</P>
<B><P>A 03.45</B>&#9;We were helped enormously by Barbara Bridges of the Gloucestershire Rural Community Council and her menu of questions, this is a nationwide menu of comprehensive questions, approximately 80, all in various sub sections, the emphasis was to be on the environment and the worry in relation to creeping development into the countryside, and this was an excellent format for us to establish our questions.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 04.18</B>&#9;How long before sending out the questionnaires and receiving them……?</P>
<B><P>A 04.26</B>&#9;It took us a long time to actually get the questionnaire together, several months, we had lots of arguments and lots of meetings and the initial group of 16 reduced down to 12.  This was quite a fractious project, actually getting the questions forming and how we wanted to do them, and we didn’t get the questionnaires out until August or September of 1997, and then began the process of collecting them and inputting the data into computers, this has been the most time consuming thing of the whole procedure.  To this very day we still haven’t got the whole thing on computer, all the details, but we are very close to it.</P>

<B><P>Q 05.24</B>&#9;What percentage of return did you get?</P>
<B><P>A 05.29</B>&#9;We were looking to the highest percentage that we possibly could as this will give us great guidance and help for anybody seeking information or corroboration of their views, housing disputes, or whatever local issues may arise.  We were lucky that we had a very high response, it was approximately 76%.  The actual percentage was difficult to pin down exactly with the inclusion of the Army Camp and with their varying population now according to their duties.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 06.04</B>&#9;Was Cerney Wick included in this?</P>
<B><P>A 06.07</B>&#9;The Parish council of South Cerney encompasses South Cerney itself, Cerney Wick and the Army Camp, that is the whole parish council.  Approximate number of questionnaires that went out was about 1,250, the returns were very close to 1,000, about 960 odd.</P>

<B><P>Q</B> <B>06.33&#9;</B>Were you pleased with that?</P>
<B><P>A 06.35</B>&#9;We were pleased, we thought it was a good response</P>

<B><P>Q 06.43</B>&#9;At this stage have you got a rough summary of  what……………….?</P>
<B><P>A 07.50</B>&#9;We’ve got a very rough summary of what we put on computer, and the overriding feeling is that South Cerney is a very friendly village and that obviously is a very good beginning, the things that were appreciated are the school, the surgery, the Post Office, the pubs the centre around the bridge and the church, and the access from the centre of the village for walks.  As anticipated the preservation of very old buildings is paramount, the church, Ann Edwards College, the village hall and the old village school.  There were suggestions to make the latter into a museum or community centre with car parking at the rear.  The things that were disliked included the excess of unsympathetic housing, nobody had anything good to say about the Water Mark’s wooden huts, nor to a lesser degree Kingfisher Place.  There were also many objections to speeding traffic particularly down Station Road and the lack of amenities for young people particularly the dearth of transport after 6.30 which prevented them from visiting Cirencester, Cheltenham or Swindon.  As a result, their hangout, which was the bus shelter was a bit of a disgrace, and there were also strong protests about litter generally and dog fouling particularly down Bow Wow, more receptacles would be appreciated.  Objections too, were raised about the excess telegraph poles and overhead cables, people would like them buried underground.  On the subject of law and order, there is a call for a greater police presence and the vacant police house causes great resentment.  There is a general feeling that because of its size and recent growth, the village really does merit a resident policeman.  The other major improvement suggested was in the centre of the village, many felt that the garage detracted from the centre and could be sited elsewhere, </P>
<P>&#9;and space used to improve the area around the doctor’s surgery, with a public convenience and more shops.  This, in spite of the failure of two shops recently.  Such a scheme might require financial help, surprisingly from the survey it was felt that the village shops were well supported by all ages in the face of supermarket competition.  Regarding Camas, it was felt generally that the works detracted greatly from the village centre and that this site would make an excellent village green with seating, lawns, fountains etc.  The further improvements that were suggested were the planting of flowers along road verges, more care of footpaths and stiles, the changing of some stiles to gates, because the elderly found them difficult and the use of the old canal and railway as cycle tracks, better lighting in alleys and walkways and improvements so that the Churn flows throughout the year, which has been a problem since time immemorial.</P>

<B><P>Q 11.38&#9;</B>How did you get the questionnaires around the village?</P>
<B><P>A 11.43&#9;</B>We managed to get the questionnaires around the village with the help of 70 volunteers, they were absolutely magnificent, and they went back and back until they had their numbers as far as they were able to do.  Many of the returns were 100% from a lot of the people and no praise is high enough for them they were magnificent, and big thanks also goes to the 7 people, who volunteered to input the information into their computers for the gathering of the report.  They spent many many hours on this and huge thanks to them</P>

<P>Q 12.45&#9;</B>Was there any particular criticism from Cerney Wick </P>




<B><P>A 12.50&#9;</B>There hasn’t been much criticism from Cerney Wick, but the interesting this is, that although we’ve been rather slow in producing the actual report, since the questionnaires were handed in the Cirencester bypass has been completed and the noise is quite horrendous at Cerney Wick.  This didn’t feature in the questionnaire but is obviously now a main issue for the residents there.  The other issue that has arisen since the return of the questionnaires is the proposed development of the playing fields at Robert Franklin Way.  This is obviously a very contentious issue and the development of that area would be highly detrimental to the facilities for the young children that use that particular area.</P>
