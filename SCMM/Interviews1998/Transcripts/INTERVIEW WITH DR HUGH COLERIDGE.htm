<B><P>Q35.17&#9;</B>When did you first come to the area?</P>
<B><P>A 35.19&#9;</B>I came in 1975, I was a houseman at Swindon, and a senior partner of the practice then, remembered me learning to ride a bicycle in my grandmothers’ garden at the age of 8, which is part of the reason I think why I got the job.  We rented a house in Robert Franklin Way for 6 months, then moved 50 yards to another one and I was there for 5 years.  During that time I started using the village hall as a surgery, and I used that for ten years on Tuesday mornings.  It was somewhat enlivened when plays and things were going on, because then I simply had to use a screen in one corner of the room, sitting behind it so all the consultations were entirely inquaro publico (?) Then after a lot of negotiation and discussion and various goings on we managed to get this surgery built, it opened in September 1995, we’ve been here ever since.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 36.28</B>&#9;Do you actually own the surgery?</P>
<B><P>A 36.30</B>&#9;The Norwich Union own the surgery, the mortgage people own the surgery.  Yes we do own it, the surgery is ours, it belongs to the practice.  We have main surgeries in Cirencester and we have another branch surgery in Kemble and we also do a branch surgery in the Royal Agricultural College, during term time.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 36.53</B>&#9;Where did you do your training?</P>
<B><P>A 36.55</B>&#9;I did my training at a reactionary establishment in London called Bart’s.  They say about Bart’s trained doctors, that you can always tell a Bart’s man, and you can’t tell a Bart’s man anything.  I worked in south London doing house jobs for two years, then I went to Uganda for 4 years.  I left when Amin threw the Asians out in 1972, I think it was.  Then I went to the Copper Belt in Zambia, I worked there for a couple of years before going to work in Swindon and then came here.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 37.47</B>&#9;Has the practice grown at all recently?</P>
<B><P>A 37.50</B>&#9;It has enormously, yes when I started I was with one partner, down the bottom of Dyer Street in a 16<SUP>th</SUP> Century cottage, with four rooms upstairs and four rooms downstairs, and in 1978 we moved up to join Dr. Mary and Dr. John Grove-White who were in Kemble, at the buildings where Christian Brann people are, and we were there until 1991, then moved up to where we are in Chesterton Lane, and we had 4,000 patients when we started and we’ve now got something in excess of 10,000, and we have 6 partners and an assistant, and we have something like 35 members of staff instead of 3, which is what I started with.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 38.46</B>&#9;How much does that take up in admin rather than doctoring?</P>
<B><P>A 38.49</B>&#9;It used to take up quite a lot, but it doesn’t take up very much now, because we have a very able practice manager and an administration team that she runs, and I have very little to do with that now.  We have a system within the practice now, we don’t have a senior partner, we have a system within the practice a kind of cabinet system of government as it were, where each partner takes responsibility for some bit of the surgery or the business and normally we have a registrar trainee in the practice who comes to the practice for a year as their introduction to general practice after they have done their hospital work.  We haven’t got one at the moment.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 39.39</B>&#9;Do you find it easy choosing partners?</P>
<B><P>A 39.42</B>&#9;No, not in the least.  We are just in the process of choosing a new partner now, because one of my partners has resigned, so we are in the throes of finding a new partner to replace her, and it takes a lot of time and effort, but finding a partner is like finding a wife or a husband, you’ve got them for life so you have to go to a lot of time and trouble to find one that is going to fit personality wise really because you can take the medical competence as read really by the time people get to that stage, you can sort it out from CVs and things, but it’s finding somebody who is going to fit with the team and other personalities we’ve got, so we’ve got a long and elaborate process of working through that which we’ve done several times now.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 40.42</B>&#9;How does the practice fit into the Local Trust as it were and the hospital?</P>
<B><P>A 40.49&#9;</B>Cirencester is funny, it is unique, I believe there is only one other hospital like it in the country.  Other doctors and administrators who come from other parts of the country, don’t understand Cirencester, it has grown historically.  It is technically speaking a sub district general hospital.  It has resident house doctors, and the beds are all consultant beds, and all the local GPs have responsibilities within the hospital with a hospital hat on as a specialist in some particular field so that our partners do various things.  Two of my partners do anesthetics, the other GP that works in this building gives anesthetics twice a week.  I do some elderly care rehabilitation work and also some casualty and orthopedic clinics, and it works very well, so all my partners are involved so in a sense we’re part time general practitioners and part time hospital doctors.  There’s much more variety and enjoyment, but it adds considerably to stresses, particularly if you’ve got to work out more than one on-call rota.  I’ve been struggling with three on-call rotas for years, I am just about to drop one, which will be a great relief.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 42.17&#9;</B>Can you explain what an on-call rota is?</P>
<B><P>A 42.19</B>&#9;We have to provide an out of hours on full rota for the practice for our patients, we have to one of our partners on call for evening and weekends.  Back in the spring of this year, all the local GPs combined to provide an on call service on a combined rota basis, so we all do shifts as it were for the on call system for out of hours and weekends, which some of us thinks works a great deal better.  It certainly improves our quality of life in many ways, but also we have to provide an on call rota for the hospital for the special team in which we work, so because I work in a casualty department I have to do weekends on call for broken limbs and the like in  casualty, and also I do one night a week there as well.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 43.12</B>&#9;There was some threat to the A &amp; E</P>
<B><P>A 43.16</B>&#9;It was blown up by the newspaper, but it was more imagined than real, there has never been any serious idea that it might be closed.  The League of Friends are raising £80,000 to build an extension on to the casualty department, because there isn’t enough room.  There’s a huge throughput there, there is no way that Cheltenham General would be able to cope with that workload and there really isn’t any threat to it.  The threat has been much more to do with complicated medico politics, to do with the housemen and how they are organised and taught and that sort of thing, than any real threat to the casualty department.  We don’t take major trauma in Cirencester, because we haven’t got the facilities for doing so, and anything that is labelled major trauma goes to Cheltenham or Gloucester or Swindon, but we still see a third of the number of patients that they see in Cheltenham in their casualty department, and it is rising steadily each year.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 44.21</B>&#9;What particularly characterises the needs of your patients in South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 44.28</B>&#9;A lot of young families.  The children and the problems that they bring with childhood complaints.  There is a collection of retired patients, old people’s bungalows, quite a lot of people seem to come here to retire. It’s actually quite a turnover of population, much more so that it used to be.  People seem to come and go a great deal more.  We get a little bit involved with the Army families, but not very much because one of the other practices in Cirencester has a branch surgery on the camp and they deal with most of it.  But there is quite a turnover, which means you keep having to meet new people and introduce new people and the Legoland houses down by the Lakes, there are some interesting families there, because a lot of them seem to be owned by people who have them as home bases and working in the Middle East, and they come home for periods of time and come and see us for this and that and then disappear off to foreign parts again for a while.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 45.40</B>&#9;When you were working in Uganda and also the Copper Belt were there any, you know, atmosphere and the way people compared with…..?</P>
<B><P>A 45.53</B>&#9;It was a totally different ball game.  When I worked in Uganda I worked in government rural hospitals and you saw all sorts of awful things, it was a very much more basic kind of medicine, you couldn’t begin to scratch the surface of most of it.  One of the hospitals I worked in we had 60 cots in the children’s ward.  20 of them were permanently occupied with children with tuberculosis, 20 of them were occupied by children with medical problems and 20 occupied by surgical problems, and there were usually 2 or 3 children to every cot, and didn’t include the mums or other relatives sleeping under the cot at night, so that you’d have upwards of 200 bodies in the ward at night for 60 cots, so it was a totally different ball game.  20% of the children who had measles died, not just ill, but 20% of those who got measles and came to the ward died of it.  People often make a fuss about their measles immunisations here, but they forget it is potentially lethal, and the tend to lose the thread about why we are doing these things, because we rarely see problems now, but that’s because they are immunised.  </P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 47.24</B>&#9;What do you feel about the tendency of people to expect you to be able to cure anything now?</P>
<B><P>A 47.31</B>&#9;People’s expectations have risen and risen and risen.  When I started I had a personal list of 2,000 patients approximately, and still have a list of 2,000 patients, but when I started I did one surgery a day of an hour and a half and that was it, and that was enough for the demand, but now doing two long surgeries a day sometimes doesn’t cope with the demand.  People’s expectations of what can be done and what can be dealt with has risen enormously, some of it is real and some of it is unreal.  There is a great deal coming through in the medical press at the moment about anxieties over antibiotics and he fact that there are now super bugs that are resistant to everything, and whether or not we should be drifting back to a state pre-antibiotics where you couldn’t treat these things, because there won’t be things to treat them with, because of misuse of antibiotics, we are being more and more leaned on not to prescribe antibiotics, unless it is absolutely necessary.  Because of resistance problems and super bugs that have learned to deal with everything.  Darwinian selection selects out the survivors.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 48.45</B>&#9;Do you see any of the population of South Cerney that you know so well, are there old types of people fading away?</P>

<B><P>A 48.57</B>&#9;Oh there are.  One of the things that has disappeared is the Gloucestershire dialect, when I first came in to practice 23 years ago, there were lots of people talking broad Gloucestershire, the older generation, and there was quite a vocabulary of words that I had to learn.  Most people came in and said it hurts when I quilt doctor, meaning that they’ve got a sore throat, nothing to do with a quilt that you put on your bed, it is a word that means hurts when I swallow.  People would come in and say my finger he do be tiart, it means my finger’s sore.  Tiart’s a lovely word, it means it hurts or it’s sore.  And they put the verb do and be together, I don’t know whether you’ve heard that, but you don’t hear it now.  The trouble about mass communication is these regional dialects disappear don’t they?  The kids used to come out of the Deer Park speaking Gloucestershire or English, depending on who they were talking to, they now come out speaking a kind of BBC yokel.  At least that’s my contention.  So I think there have been a lot of changes, the old Gloucestershire people just disappear; there is a generation that’s gone.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 50.23</B>&#9;How many people do you have in the practice?</P>
<B><P>A 50.30</B>&#9;As far as this surgery is concerned, there is of course a wider team, when I started there was just two of us working the surgery, we did have a health visitor and a district nurse.  We had a very old a very old fashioned type, wonderful district nurse, who was very much of the old school, here comes nurse with a red hot poultice, slaps it on and takes no notice.  But things have grown a lot since then, we are very much dependent on a wider team, and that’s true in this surgery as well as the main one.  When I did the village hall once a week there was nothing else, but working out of this surgery, we now have a midwife who comes and does a clinic once a week.  She comes and sees antenatal mums here, and we have a practice nurse here two mornings a week and she does her own clinic.   She does travel immunisations, smears, dressings, blood pressure checks, asthma checks, diabetes checks and one of the things that’s changed a lot is how practice nurses have taken on the follow up and supervision of patients with specific problems such as diabetes and asthma, nurses are much better than doctors about being obsessional on following through and keeping things in due order and following chronic conditions.  We also have a health visitor’s clinic here once a month or once a fortnight on Tuesday morning, so it gets a bit like Paddy’s market out there and there’s a cr&egrave;che out there with children roaring around, and some of the older patients retreating into a corner and wondering quite what’s hit them, children roaring up and down the corridor, and the health visitor doing a clinic and the nurse giving immunisations, and I think it’s great fun, it’s all part of the wider team, and we have a very good team of district nurses.  One of the things that has changed in recent years is that district nurses used to be employed by the Health Authorities, and they used to come into the surgery and talk to us when they needed to, but now the district nurses have offices in our main surgery, and they are very much part of the team.  We met with them regularly, we talk to them regularly, sometimes do joint visits together and they give us things that they want us to do and we can delegate and give them things that they want to do.  They come into this building quite often and use the facilities sometimes as well, so the GP is only part of much wider primary health care team.  And you need a very able practice manager who is a good personal organiser to organise all that and keep it together.  One of the things that makes this building work very well is our receptionist here, who is a very good networker in terms of talking to people and making people feel welcome and keeping everybody communicating with all these different skills and disciplines.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 53.24</B>&#9;Do you have any clinical link with the school?</P>
<B><P>A 53.28</B>&#9;Not really no, only inasmuch as there are children who are patients of this practice, and there are a lot of them in this village so that we have links with the school in that way.  The health visitor goes into the school sometimes to talk about particular problems, so we do have some indirect contacts.  I have been a governor of the school for a very long time, which has given me a personal interest in the school, my three children have been through the village school, and I’ve seen the old school pulled down and the new building put up.  One of the things that I tried to get organised when the new school was built, I tried to interest the then village hall committee to combine with the school and build a super village hall, but they wanted to keep their thatched village hall.  We could have had a really big community resource there, the Education Authority were perfectly happy to have a combined building, which would have been a really big building and something that could be used by the whole village that would have been big enough, but that’s past history.  Something I haven’t talked about is that upstairs in this building there is a consulting suite, and there are a number of complementary practitioners, which is something that this practice has been very keen on, drawing in complementary practitioners into the wider team, and in the main surgery we have an osteopath and acupuncturist, who comes and does sessions in the building and works with us and upstairs there are some private complementary practitioners who do sessions for people who want to  make use of them and there is a therapeutic massage person, there’s an acupuncturist, there is a homeopathic practitioner, a reflexologist.  Since we own it upstairs and we rent it to them, and we have some say in who comes here, so we keep out the more outrageous fringe complementary practitioners, some of whom I’m afraid to say are charlatans, but the ones we know and talk to are clearly very helpful and have a lot to offer, especially in terms of time and energy for people.</P>

<B><P>Q55.49</B>&#9;I once heard a doctor say that you don’t know everything, you can’t necessarily cure people, but you can reassure them, what do you think about that?</P>
<B><P>A 56.08</B>&#9;You can certainly try to reassure them, and we are certainly able to make diagnoses more often.  I think we hope we will arrive at a reasonably accurate diagnosis of what the matter with somebody is nowadays. Part of the difficulty is that people think everything is black and white and it isn’t, nothing biological is completely black and white.  And when something is clear cut and cut and dried it’s fine, but people view tests and investigations as being either yes or no, but they’re not, frequently there is a huge grey area and you can’t say whether it actually matters or it doesn’t matter, and sometimes it takes a lot of explaining.  When I trained in medicine, you never told the patient anything at all, you never told them anything about what the matter with them was, and they weren’t expected to know and they weren’t expected to ask, but nowadays I spend a lot of my time explaining to people what is going on, and drawing diagrams and showing them models, and trying to explain to them, so they have a good idea of what is going on, and the whole emphasis now is that you explain to people what the matter with them is and leave them to make judgements about what kind of treatment they would like on the basis of what you have been able to explain to them.  It can get very complicated and difficult, particularly if it is something complex and the answers about the treatment are not cut and dried.</P>

<B><P>Q 58.15</B>&#9;Do you enjoy the specialisation or is it the general practice….?</P>
<B><P>A 58.18</B>&#9;I think one of the wonderful things about working in Cirencester is that we’ve got both, we have a special subject and a special interest we can get involved in and we can set that against the wider scale of general practice so you’ve much less change of getting bored or burned out in one particular sphere, which is an enormous blessing, we’re very lucky.  I sometimes think Cirencester is like the little world of ……………? Did you ever read those stories, wonderful stories about a Catholic priest and a Communist mayor, and they were the best of friends in private and the worst of enemies in public, and they lived in a little town in the Po Valley and what went on in the outer world just didn’t exist.  There was this wonderful picture of this little town where everything was in a microcosm, Rome was out there somewhere but it might as well have been on the other side of the moon for all the impact it had.  Cirencester is very like that sometimes people are very focused, they read the newspaper with great interest don’t they, and what goes on in the outer world really doesn’t matter too much.</P>
