</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Originally the idea came from Steve Coffey who wanted, through the Millennium Committee to make a CD ROM about the Parish and its history, to give to the children of the village a better keepsake than the traditional mug that inevitably got broken. For his CD he wanted a few interviews, and so he asked Raymond Fenton and Ann Turner to collect a few short interviews with interesting people.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To get a 60 seconds extract it is necessary to actually record at least ten times that amount of talk, and in some cases it is necessary to ask some preliminary questions just to get the subject relaxed. After we had done our first three interviews we soon discovered that our subjects, once warmed up, were only too happy to talk about their past. Before we realised what was happening we had collected between 15 and 45 minutes of the most fascinating material from each of our first few subjects.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As time went on and we talked to more people our library of tapes grew and we soon came to the conclusion that here was a collection of interviews that should be preserved for the future as archive material. Archives are of no value if they are locked away, never to be seen, so we realised that we simply had to make this material into a film about the village. Our original intention was to make a nice neat documentary film of about 50 minutes in length. This was not to be. We worked on through July to October 1998 collecting not only interviews, but also pictorial shots of the villages, their surroundings and the houses and gardens of the people interviewed. In addition our subjects and many of their friends and relations lent us wonderful old photographs that supported the facts that we had been collecting on tape.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By the time November had arrived, we had interviewed 38 people, had collected over 29 hours of valuable tape material and also over 500 scanned pictures to use in the making of the film. To edit all this material was a very daunting task. However it had to be done. Naturally with so much spoken word it was essential to be able to see it in front of us, to be able to make decisions as to who’s words should be used and in what order. It was at this point that we approached Janet Bush for help. Janet runs a secretarial bureau from her house under the name of the Bush Telegraph. Our original material was on twenty nine, one hour long Hi8 tapes. These were copied, three at a time onto normal, three hour long, VHS tapes. In the copy we had the Hi8 machine add what is known as the time code. This means that the running time in hours, minutes, seconds and frames, (25 frames to the second) was shown on top of the picture.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Janet spent many hours with her hands darting between the computer keyboard and the remote control of her video recorder while she typed out every word that had been spoken, and listed every scenic shot that had been taken. Not just that, in a separate margin she also had to add the time code so that we could easily find any shot on any of the 29 reels. When finished we found that she had typed for us a total of 112,689 words with 585,311 characters.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next stage belonged to Ann Turner as the producer. A spare copy of all these scripts was cut up with scissors. Each paragraph, or even sentence that concerned specific subjects was dropped into the appropriate box. Thus she had a box marked &quot;school&quot;, another marked &quot;war&quot;, another marked &quot;flower show&quot; another marked &quot;Cerney Wick&quot;, etc. Each subject matter was taken in turn and the words shuffled to form a flowing story with the minimum amount of interjection from the commentator, necessary sometimes to preserve continuity.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each of these sections as they were completed were passed through to Raymond, who changed his roll from being cameraman, to being editor. These spoken sections then had to be found in the original camera tapes and strung together to make sense, with all the relevant scenic shots and still photographs added where appropriate. This exercise took us through November, December and the first part of January, so that we finished this part with some 45 or so semi-edited sections.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ann then went off on holiday for two weeks while Raymond did a first rough assembly of the various sections. Putting them in order and creating the necessary links between the sections. This done and we found that our original idea of a 50 minute film had grown into a three part film totalling nearly five hours. This was naturally much too long, and anyway would never fit onto a VHS tape for distribution purposes. Raymond then went away for a few days holiday while Ann had the terrible task of deciding how to cut out at least one hour. The film was then roughly edited again, and we found that our mathematics were correct, and we were now down to just under four hours in total.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next stage was to finalise the wording for the commentary. This had to form the link between sections and also to add information at places where no person had spoken what was necessary. Ann had written some of it, and Raymond had roughed out other sections. Ann spent four days working on it before we had a meeting to finalise exactly what needed to be said and where. A few days later Raymond Thilthorpe came in and sat before a microphone to make the recording.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final stages were approaching. March had arrived and the date for the official premiere had been fixed. Invitations sent out and acceptances were pouring in. The pressure was definitely on. For the first two weeks of March Raymond worked on, carefully putting together each edited section with the appropriate sections of commentary. Ann popped in frequently to check on the work and give support and advice. Extra pictures were added in a few places, and by the last week of March the film was finished. Three separate Hi8 tapes held the masters and these were copied onto professional Betacam tape with sound compression and limitations ready for sending off to a laboratory to turn into 500 VHS copies. In the mean time Raymond was busy producing the design for the tape box and the tape labels.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was no way that we could show all four hours worth at the opening film premiere, so one final job had to be done. A further cutting task had to be initiated and another much shortened version of the film prepared ready for the initial showings in the South Cerney Village Hall.</P>
