</U></FONT><P>Q 35.56&#9;</B>Where did you come from originally?</P>




<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>A 35.58</B>&#9;Originally, I come from Hong Kong.  I’ve been here for about 27 years and I did my education here, I also studied the higher national diploma in business studies and I also worked in a government office at one time, but for a long, long time …..? cooking.  My mum also had a restaurant when I was little.  I was helping my mum a lot. ……………….? It would be good for me to open a restaurant myself.  My wife also is a midwife, she gave me so much support she even forego her career to help me out ………………? So she helped me a lot to be in charge of the restaurant or else I cannot do myself because there is so much responsibility.  Yesterday we kept tidying and tidying and people kept coming in and I was exhausted I couldn’t do it anymore.  ……We have to clean up and go home and I come back early to patch up all this mess.</P>

<B><P>Q 37.31</B>&#9;Where did you do your training for cooking?</P>
<B><P>A 37.34</B>&#9;I was born with my cooking skill and my mum mainly is a very good cook and I learned from my mum.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 37.45</B>&#9;Why did you choose South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 37.47</B>&#9;When we started we looked in Cirencester, but they haven’t got the premises, it was all fully occupied and we don’t quite like Swindon; it’s just not our cup of tea. Bristol not really. We wanted to open our restaurant in a pleasant area with pleasant people.  Cirencester and Tetbury were fully occupied.  These towns were very interesting, but in the end we ended up in here, because it was the only empty one at the time. I know it is risky because it is quite a small village and you don’t have much passing trade especially in the wintertime.  Wintertime is a very quiet time so we have to rely on our quality food, this is our fourth year now, our business has built up and our name has spread.  In the wintertime it is quite quiet and the springtime is quite quiet, but we do have some people from Tetbury and Bibury and from North Cerney, Cerney Wick.  We are the only restaurant to survive here for so long in here.  In the past there have been two restaurants before me, but both of them just went bankrupt.</P>
<P>So it’s our fourth year now with a lot of help from local people.  The longer we stay here the more people get to know about us.  People are very nice, Mr Fenton is very nice.  We always see Mr Fenton on big occasions.  New Year, Christmas, Chinese New Year, everything.</P>

<B><P>Q 41.15&#9;</B>When you were brought up in Hong Kong this village must be very different?</P>
<B><P>A 41.17&#9;</B>No not really, in Hong Kong it is a mixed culture East and West really mix so well. The West like the beautiful, the Oriental, and the East people like the independence, the human rights the outspoken attitudes, it mix so well, that’s why Hong Kong at that time was so wealthy.  English and Chinese work together so nicely and our cultures are quite a lot the same because we have integrity, some of the English are quite reserved we don’t do something too boldly, but then Chines are the same.  Sometimes you meet the Chinese in here and it is different, because they are not educated people.  They probably finish primary school and they cannot continue, most of the Chinese take away, they are different Chinese, you mix with the higher level of Chinese, those who have gone through education and so on, they are just like you and me.</P>

<P>Q 42.47</B>&#9;Do you find it so strange in South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 42.49</B>&#9;No I don’t find it strange at all, we like it so much, especially my wife and I.  So pleasant.  The local people come in and talk about life, talk about the village and about their career even.  We call each other by name.  The longer we stay the more fun we get.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 43.28</B>&#9;Do you also do take aways?</P>
<B><P>A 43.29</B>&#9;Yes we do.  My wife remembers so many of the names, even when they ring up, she knows their names so well, yet I seldom come down, I spend most of my time in the kitchen, so I don’t see the customers as much as my wife.  My wife can even recognise voices on the telephone.  As I say if this was Cirencester there would be more people passing by, which is even better, but people who live hear might not like it rally when the traffic passes through here because it destroys the village tranquility.</P>

<B><P>Q 44.28</B>&#9;Do you have many customers from the Water Mark?</P>
<B><P>A 44.30</B>&#9;Not many, only some of the time.  In wintertime it is all empty, but in summertime Hoburne and Water Mark we do have some from there, but mainly local.  The Hoburne they do come in here but only mainly take away because our price to sit down and take away is so different, about 20% more.  It is a small restaurant and if we do it too cheap people would be queuing up to come in and a lot of customers would be very unhappy if they have to wait so long to get a table so we can’t do it too cheap really.  We get people from Ciren because we are cheaper than the one in town, they come in, so that’s why we’ve got the problem to accommodate all of them.   </P>
