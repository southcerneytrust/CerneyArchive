<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 17.54&#9;&#9;</B>What’s your name?</P>
<B><P>A 17.55&#9;</B>&#9;Ian Musty.</P>

<B><P>Q 17.58</B>&#9;&#9;Were you born in South Cerney?</P>




<B><P>A 18.02</B>&#9;I was born in Swindon.  I moved to Quenington at the age of 4 and South Cerney at the age of 6, where I went to Ann Edwards School.</P>

<B><P>Q 18.45</B>&#9;What was that like?</P>
</FONT><B><P>A 18.47</B>&#9;Very enjoyable. I think the main reason it was enjoyable was because of the teachers there, they were very friendly people.  They weren’t just your teachers they were there to help, to be your friend, and the friends I have now are people who went to primary school with me so that’s good.  </P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<B><P>Q 19.14</B>&#9;So you sort of forged roots with contemporaries, how many?</P>
<B><P>A 19.22</B>&#9;At least a dozen who live in the village now, 3 or 4 became close friends and started secondary school with me at Kingshill.  It was quite upsetting to see your other friends go on to Deer Park or Farmors, but most of my friends joined with me at Kingshill, so I didn’t really lose the friendships.</P>

<B><P>Q 20.20</B>&#9;Did you specailise in any subject when you were at Kingshill?</P>
<B><P>A 20.02</B>&#9;English and Drama I specailised in I received my results, GCSE results, which were quite pleasing for me because in English and Drama I did excel, and I’m going on to further education to study that as well.</P>

<B><P>Q20.26</B>&#9;Where are you going?</P>
<B><P>A 20.28</B>&#9;I’m going to Cirencester College to Study Drama, it’s an English course but it’s not actually English.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 20.39</B>&#9;What do you enjoy acting particularly?</P>
<B><P>A 20.41</B>&#9;Most things really, for me drama is something you can enjoy, you can act anybody, just relax and it’s a release from everyday life really.</P>

<B><P>Q 21.04</B>&#9;Do you enjoy Shakespeare?</P>
<B><P>A 21.07</B>&#9;I like some aspects of Shakespeare but I like writing about Shakespeare more than I enjoy performing Shakespeare.</P>

<B><P>Q 21.23</B>&#9;You don’t find his interesting dialogue, some of his characters…..?</P>
<B><P>A 21.32</B>&#9;The characters are very much in depth, I suppose you could perform Shakespeare in a number of ways.  I mean I think Richard II, which has just come out at the theatre, and I watched a documentary on it and one of the actors said there were a number of ways you could perform it and he chose a more complex way because he really wanted to bring it out.</P>

<B><P>Q 22.12</B>&#9;What modern playwrights do you particularly like?</P>
<B><P>A 22.22</B>&#9;I studied Macbeth at school that was for course work.</P>

<B><P>Q 22.34</B>&#9;Modern playwrights?</P>
<B><P>A 22.38</B>&#9;I can’t say that I do actually.</P>

<B><P>Q 22.42</B>&#9;Have you ever been to the Brewery Theatre with Chaos Company.</P>
<B><P>A 22.50</B>&#9;I’ve been to the Aldwich Theatre in the centre of London with my GCSE drama group to watch Amy’s View with Dame Judi Dench, and that was a good experience just to see the theatre and how they project the performances.</P>

<B><P>Q 23.25</B>&#9;Have you been behind the scenes in any theatres?</P>
<B><P>A 23.30</B>&#9;Not yet, I hope to though. To go on work experience and see behind the scenes.</P>

<B><P>Q 23.45</B>&#9;What about improvisation, do you do any of that?</P>
<B><P>A 23.47</B>&#9;I enjoy that aspect of drama; it’s good fun.  Just do things on the spot and use your imagination to bring out a cameo character.</P>

<B><P>Q 24.06</B>&#9;Have you seen or do you take part in any of the local amateur things?</P>
<B><P>A 24.12</B>&#9;Not as yet no.  The South Cerney Players and there are actually two youth theatres around, but I haven’t joined yet.</P>

<B><P>Q 24.26</B>&#9;So what do you do with your spare time when you are not working for exams and stuff?  </P>
<B><P>A 24.35</B>&#9;I’m in the middle of writing a short story and I play a lot of sport, football and cricket.</P>

<B><P>Q 24.47</B>&#9;Is there a flourishing South Cerney Cricket Club?</P>
<B><P>A 24.50</B>&#9;The youth crick hasn’t really developed in South Cerney so I have gone to neighbouring villages to play, and I’m involved with Poulton Club at the moment and Stratton Football Club.</P>

<B><P>Q 25.16</B>&#9;Do you think more could be done in the way of help for sport for young….?</P>
<B><P>A 25.23</B>&#9;I think if there was a person willing to step out and say I’ll take charge of the youth scheme it would improve the situation of sport around South Cerney at a young age, because there are a lot of willing people who would like to play football, cricket and tennis.</P>

<B><P>Q 25.49</B>&#9;Are you not old enough now to start organising it for yourself?</P>
<B><P>A 25.51</B>&#9;My brother who’s interested in a lot of sport and wants to be a coach and go on and teach youngsters in a foreign country or Britain, so I think we could when we get older discuss it, but I haven’t really thought about it.</P>

<B><P>Q 26.24</B>&#9;Does music come into your life at all?</P>
<B><P>A 26.30</B>&#9;Very slightly yes, the pop aspect hasn’t really appealed to me. I’ve always kind of strayed away from the popular music.  It’s been rock and roll for me; there are a couple of bands in South Cerney that perform rock and roll so it’s good.</P>

<B><P>Q 26.57</B>&#9;Do they rehearse much?</P>
<B><P>A 27.59</B>&#9;I don’t actually know, but I’ve seen posters and flyers for bands playing locally in Cirencester and South Cerney.</P>

<B><P>Q 27.15</B>&#9;If you’re going to be an actor, singing might be useful</P>
<B><P>A 27.20</B>&#9;My mother keeps telling me that.</P>

<B><P>Q 27.27</B>&#9;What else do you think could be done for younger people in South Cerney …if there are any complaints, let’s hear them.</P>
<B><P>A 27.43</B>&#9;I think obviously for enjoyment the youth scheme for sport could be improved.  I think maybe we have a lot of lakes and greenery around South Cerney not to build over it but to introduce the wildlife to young people, I think that would be a good option.</P>

<B><P>Q 28.26</B>&#9;Do you feel the village has got big enough? </P>
<B><P>A 28.31</B>&#9;Has got big enough?</P>

<B><P>Q 28.34</B>&#9;Well no more building</P>
<B><P>A 28.36</B>&#9;I think if the building continues as it is, South Cerney will be a town in five to ten years.  They’re building over where I used to go for walks, for Sunday strolls with the family and you just can’t go there anymore because there are towering buildings in the way.  It’s a shame really because there are a lot of lakes and picnic spots that have gone to waste because of construction.</P>

<B><P>Q 29.24</B>&#9;When you are altogether with your friends, what do you like doing?</P>
<B><P>A 29.28</B>&#9;There used to be a youth club down at the village hall.  I think some of the juveniles have kind of made it a bit of a mess, smashing windows taking chairs out of buildings and things like that, so no-one wants to go there any more it’s just dangerous.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 30.17</B>&#9;What do you think makes them?</P>
<B><P>A 30.20</B>&#9;I’ve no idea.  To impress people, I don’t know.  At that age some people do. Could be a number of reasons.</P>

<B><P>Q 30.42</B>&#9;But if they are allowed to get away with it, can you not make……………..?</P>
<B><P>A 30.53</B>&#9;The older kids go along with it as well, there needs to be a more experienced person looking after, and there should be all the people looking out for this sort of behaviour because it’s irrational, there’s no need for it.  It’s a shame that the youth club has gone to extremes like putting on discos and things and they are just saying we don’t like it.</P>

<B><P>Q 31.40</B>&#9;What do you think they would really appreciate?</P>
<B><P>A 31.43</B>&#9;Better ask them I don’t know.</P>

<B><P>Q 31.53</B>&#9;They’ve got no way of entertaining themselves, and interesting thoughts about?</P>
<B><P>A 31.59</B>&#9;They are usually the kind of children who go to school and don’t learn anything they just go to show off and be rebellious.  I’m not going to mention any names.</P>

<B><P>Q 32.32</B>&#9;Have you ever worked in the Water Park as a holiday job?</P>
<B><P>A 32.36</B>&#9;I haven’t. I know a lot of people who do.  I haven’t applied for a job there.  I would probably see it as an option later on.</P>

<B><P>Q 32.59</B>&#9;Are you doing a lot of preparatory work before going to college?</P>
<B><P>A 33.13</B>&#9;You mean job work or?</P>

<B><P>Q 33.17</B>&#9;I just wondered if they gave you student books to read or anything</P>
<B><P>A 33.22</B>&#9;Not really.  There are a lot of options up at the college now, the day before your actual teaching starts you are given a look round where you are going to be based and other areas of the college so you may get some books then, I don’t know.</P>

<B><P>Q 33.49</B>&#9;Are you looking forward to it?</P>
<B><P>A 33.54</B>&#9;Yes I’m looking forward to it.  Like I said I’m studying what I enjoy, what I practice and I really can excel at that.</P>

<B><P>Q 34.08</B>&#9;Also you will be meeting people in other societies there</P>
<B><P>Q 34.14</B>&#9;Have you been abroad on school trips or with your parents?</P>

<B><P>A 34.17</B>&#9;I’ve been to Turkey and Portugal with my family.  I haven’t been abroad with the school.  Like I say I’ve been to the theatre in London with the school, but I’ve been away with my family to Turkey.</P>

<B><P>Q 34.42</B>&#9;Did you enjoy that?</P>
<B><P>A 34.44</B>&#9;Yes that was very enjoyable.  They are very friendly people. We’ve been twice to Turkey.  They were so similar in the end we couldn’t decide which was which, because the people were so friendly, the two people we met each time were equally friendly.</P>

<B><P>Q 35.16</B>&#9;What part of Turkey were you in?</P>
<B><P>A 35.17</B>&#9;Marmorus(?) It was near the Blue Lagoon, very very nice, mountainside and beach.</P>

<B><P>Q 35.37</B>&#9;Did you feel any comparisons with South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 35.39</B>&#9;I think the friendliness I think.  You could go to local people and say where’s such and such and they would greet you with a smile, it’s kind of the same here sometimes.</P>

<B><P>Q 36.05</B>&#9;Yet people feel that South Cerney is a very friendly village, do you not think so in your generation?</P>
<B><P>A 36.15</B>&#9;I think my generation is quite friendly, people I grew up with at primary school, they’re fairly friendly people that’s why I get on with them so well.  I think if a tourist was to come here they would find it friendly, because it is.  A lot of older people are friendly as well.</P>

<B><P>Q 36.40</B>&#9;Is it 16’s and down, what is the age group that is not so?</P>
<B><P>A 36.56</B>&#9;13, 14 or maybe even 15.</P>

<B><P>Q 37.04</B>&#9;Do you think their parents ought to ………………….?</P>
<B><P>A 37.09</B>&#9;Yes.  It’s in certain parts of South Cerney where I think their parents have got to work the hours of the day when they don’t get to meet their children very often.  I think we ought to respect that, but  at the same time there should be someone to look out for the children, and say you shouldn’t do that you should do this.  You should have respect for other people, you don’t go around smashing up youth clubs and things.  Someone ought to take control I think.</P>

<B><P>Q 38.06</B>&#9;……………Children are fairly fair-minded when things are pointed out to them?</P>
<B><P>A 38.08</B>&#9;Some children are and some children can say I’m not listening and just ignore them and say I want to be with my friends. They want to show off in front of their friends and make themselves look the part.  I’ve no idea why, but that’s just they way they are around here.  </P>

<B><P>Q 38.40</B>&#9;Do you watch much television?</P>
<B><P>A 38.43</B>&#9;Yes, when I get home from school. I’m on holiday now so television’s kind of been priority every day more or less.  I’ve been getting up rather late, in the afternoon.  They show a lot of sport after 12 o’clock on Channel 5, I’ve been watching that.</P>

<B><P>Q 39.40</B>&#9;What else do you enjoy on television?</P>
<B><P>A 39.45</B>&#9;I like talk shows, debates, things like that, anything really.  Gerry Springer is a favourite of mine, very lively.</P>

<B><P>Q 40.06</B>&#9;You don’t think it’s humiliating for some of the people?</P>
<B><P>A 40.09</B>&#9;Some of the subjects are a little extreme, but the American lifestyle’s always been a little bit eccentric so you can account for that.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 40.26</B>&#9;Would you like to visit America?</P>
<B><P>A 40.29</B>&#9;I’d like to yes.  Some of the American sports I have just begun to like.  Baseball mainly because I think Britain has just started to incorporate it into our country sport, but it hasn’t really proved a standard yet.</P>

<B><P>Q 41.00</B>&#9;Do you watch any of the………………..?</P>
<B><P>A 41.04</B>&#9;Yes…………………………?</P>

<B><P>Q 41.18</B>&#9;Do you ever do dance movement and that sort of thing towards acting………?</P>
<B><P>A 41.28</B>&#9;The course I do, you can study it, but it is optional. You can excel into different areas of performing arts, dance, art, music and drama, so there is a number of areas of study that you can study.  It’s a National Diploma an 18-hour course, and I am taking GCSE maths as well, because I didn’t do too well there.</P>

<B><P>Q 42.20</B>&#9;Do you do computer studies?</P>
<B><P>A 42.24</B>&#9;Of  the game kind yes, I don’t profess to be a computer programmer or anything, but I do enjoy computers.</P>

<B><P>Q 42.36</B>&#9;Do you think it’s a good idea to give the kids a CD-ROM in the village?</P>
<B><P>A 42.40</B>&#9;Yes, because you might age, but once it is recorded on a CD you can play it anywhere you can even have a film on CD.  It’s amazing what the future has in store really.</P>
