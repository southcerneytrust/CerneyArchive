<B><P>Q (40.42)&#9;</B>Can you tell us the purpose of the Water Park?</P>




<B><P>A (40.33)</B>&#9;Cotswold Water Park was formed really as a planning zone.  It corresponds to the area that has gravel under the ground, so it really confines the area that can be dug for gravel, so we don’t get lakes sprawling all the way down the Thames Valley and it corresponds to the upper Thames flood plain.  We’ve now got a wide area of lakes and a couple of years ago the Cotswold Water Park had to be extend to keep the ten year land bank of gravel that is required by government.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (41.38)&#9;</B>Inaudible question</P>
<B><P>A ( 41.46)</B>&#9;The Cotswold Water Park has a concentration around the South Cerney Asthon Keynes area, and the lakes around South Cerney have got quite a lot of activities on them, various watersports, but also holiday accommodation, things such as Water Mark that have come up in the last 8 years or so and there is still room for nature conservation in the area, and it’s a matter keeping some sort of balance between conservation, recreation and the commercial aspect of digging gravel and  obviously not forgetting the needs and the lifestyle that the residents of the area and visitors to the area would like. It can’t all be written off to making money from gravel and making money from recreation.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q (42.52)&#9;</B>Inaudible question</P>
<B><P>A (42.59)</B>&#9;The nearest tripli…(?) to South Cerney are meadow sites, along Wilmer Lane along towards the canal and there are a couple outside the Water Park, but predominantly in the Water Park we have about 10 tripli…..(?) on the mild forming lakes such as lake 10 and the manor brook fishery lake, the large number of lakes that we have around here, about 130 lakes are all of varying degrees of interest particularly to over-wintering birds, but the mild forming lakes are particularly unusual in lowland areas.  It’s were calcium carbonate is precipitated out and you get a calcareous base forming on the lake which then has a very different flora to it and attracts different over-wintering birds.  There are some very uncommon stone worts let me assure you out in this lake for example that aren’t found anywhere else in the south of England and they’re especially attractive for over-wintering birds to graze on, the diving ducks to graze on.  Lake 12 is another one for example, which has a lot of over-wintering birds on it because of the stone worts in the bottom of the lake.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q (44.42)&#9;</B>Are there any particularly ………………?</P>
<B><P>A (44.46)&#9;</B>Well there’s a topical one at the moment; there have been a couple of sightings within the last two months of otters in the Water Park.  We haven’t been short of mink for a while now we have had them in this area probably longer than I’ve been here, and that feels a while now .  Otters we haven’t had for along time, we are starting to get muntjack deer sighted around here and seen far more signs of roe deer.  Fallow I think are still on the eastern side of the 419, which is of course still Water Park, but not within the Parish.  I think we regard ourselves more particularly in terms of interesting wild life when we are looking at birds as being particularly of interest to anyone who wants to get out and about particularly in winter time and some interesting breeding birds.  Such as we have a good number of hobbies every spring, they migrate through the area, and I’ve seen up to 17 over one lake down on the Minety straight, the Swillbrook Lakes, so a lot of those will move on to other sites, but people will travel a long way just to see one hobby and to see 17 is quite a magnificent site.  Good colonies of sandmartins, good waders and a lot of chance sightings of birds that appear from nowhere.  For instance last year we had a Squacco(?) heron that should have been down in the Mediterranean, we had birds that flew in from America.  From the air we must look very distinctive and very attractive with so much water, birds tend to home in on us, so there are always surprises to be found if you get out looking for them.  Floristically as well, I guess I ought to mention we’ve got some very nice meadows triplisized (?) as we mentioned, things like fritillaries, marsh helobrines were found in large numbers the other day, not far from South Cerney in Gypsy Lane, some very attractive areas that have rather been left to go to nature which is wonderful as far as I’m concerned, and you get a site like Keynes Park here which is rather written off to the visitor side of things and breeding birds have to be very tolerant of disturbances from dogs and things, but there are still some lovely sites around the Water Park that wouldn’t have been round here if it hadn’t have been for the gravel industry.  The changes that we have had in the water park that have affected me to a lesser or greater extent depending on how you look at it are, politically we used to be managed by a joint committee with representative from Gloucestershire and Wiltshire County Councils and we had representatives from Cotswold District and North Wilts District Councils, the people like English Nature were all there around the table and they were in effect my employers.  Now because that was a local government set up and money has got quite a lot tighter over the last decade or so, education, houses, health take more and more of a priority in budgets and countryside recreation used to always get a very small slice and now w are down to crumbs and so that was the writing on the wall and we weren’t eligible to get a grant from European aid sources because we were local government, and the answer to that was to become a charitable trust, or a not for profit organisation, and we can now get money from land-fill tax, from European union sources and other forms of sponsorship so that allows us to do more of the things we would like to be doing.  Landfill tax we always tried to do conservation and site improvement works with that income. We’ve got large plans for some reed beds over on the Shorncote sewage works site, which the Environment Agency are doing their best to snooker at the moment which is a bit frustrating, but we’ve been working on that site for a couple of years, moving it along and we’ve had visitors from Japan, Russia, Indonesia, all over the place, looking at these sites and so they’re obviously very interesting, but it’s just getting them off the ground, it’s just the quality of the water, it should flow rather than be impounded.  They don’t want water coming down into the water table and the….? and I would support that very much, 
but we’ve got to find a way around that so we can create what will be about a 10 hectare reed bed and a 17 hectare site which will be open to the public; there is a footpath through there anyway, but we’d like to attract school groups into the area, to do pond dipping and to do all sorts of outdoor education and study days and use the hides and things but also hopefully we will get bitterns coming to breed there.  I nearly trod on a bittern last winter, so they’re around but breeding perhaps I ought to stop treading on them, but breeding they are not a bird that we can claim breeds in this area.  One day hopefully we might be able to, so the more money we can get for projects like that the better it will be in future for the Water Park.  There is a staff of 4 rangers now, plus volunteer rangers and in the summer we go up to about a dozen with car park attendants and lifeguards for the swimming beach.  The wintertime we tend to do conservation work and spread ourselves throughout the area right over to Lechlade.  We have about 50 miles of public rights of way that we look after and try to keep in good order. There are 130 lakes, 1,800 hectares of land and lakes within the Cotswold Water Park area, trying to work in hectares, rather than square miles or acres, we’ve got to look to the future on that one.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q (53.03)&#9;</B>Inaudible question</P>
<B><P>A (53.06)&#9;</B>We take school groups round.  We’d love to take more school groups round and we’d like to have the staff to do so, they aren’t as numerous as I’d like them to be as we haven’t got any facilities to get them in out of the weather.   We do charge for school groups, but we are told it is a very minimal amount compared to a lot of sites.  We get people coming from quite far afield, more particularly nowadays we seem to be getting university groups.  When I started here 15 years ago, it was more primary school groups on a nature ramble, and it’s gradually got more and more serious with the national curriculum and university groups studying the effects of man on the environment and re-instatement of lakes and all sorts of very technical subjects that they come to look at, it keeps me on my toes.  But as far as the public is concerned and groups of the public walking around, we’re starting to do guided walks.  In the past the past we’ve never really had the manpower and the time to do guided walks, but now we’ve decided that we must make that effort to keep the staff free on a busy Sunday and put the responsibility more on the lifeguards, so we can free up a couple of members of staff to take a walk with members of the public. That’s a new departure for us, but old hat for many rangers I know, they are quite shocked that we don’t do guided walks around here. It’s a very large area to tackle and lots of walks could be done, and I enjoy doing them, it’s just the pressure of time excuse.</P>




<B><P>(53.08)&#9</P></B>Yes, we’ve got the otter sitting here on the edge of Keynes Country Park, and I apologise for the background noise, but it is an industrial area after all and we’ve got gravel winning going on all the time in the Water Park, and the background noise, apart from the wind, is the Gloucester Sand and Gravel Company digging another lake over nearer to Someford Keynes, so it is not all peace and birdsong all the time in the Water Park, but there are places to get away from it all.</LI></OL>



<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q (55.50)&#9;</B>Inaudible question</P>




<B><P>A (55.53)</B>&#9;I would like to see, this is wish list time, I would like to see more facilities as Keynes Country Park for days when the sun isn’t shining and there’s rain clouds looming large on the weather map.  Facilities for young children to come and learn a bit more about the Water Park with and interpretation centre or a visitors’ centre, but also some play equipment, perhaps a drop slide or something like that which would help our revenue. When it’s poor weather, we don’t get any revenue from car parking charges, so that’s quite high up on the wish list, but on a wider Water Park theme, more money please to do conservation work.  That would suit me well to do more contract hedge laying and things like that which would improve the environment and really make the Water Park something special, a well managed and well maintained area, because farmers always used to do the management of hedgerows.  Gravel companies aren’t interested in that, so we’ve got a problem where land is not being looked after as well as it should be in hedges and woodlands and things.  And if we had the money I would like to say lay the hedge along the Spine Road  so we could get a cycle route in, so people could cycle safely separated from the traffic.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q (57.42)&#9;</B>Inaudible question</P>
<B><P>A (57.45)&#9;</B>Cerney Wick copse is a lovely sight, sparrowhawks next there, tawny owls. Deer shelter in there, and it’s an unusual site because it is grazed copse.   Quite an old management form, but it has probably been over grazed, so we weren’t getting any natural regeneration.  What I have been doing over the last ten years is taking areas out of the grazing coppicing them and letting them regenerate.  Unfortunately that is a job that should have been done 50 years ago, and the bramble has got really well established in there.  The hazel coppice is going to dominate and is starting to dominate already.  I would like to do more work in there but unfortunately the arrangement with the farmer was, he would get the firewood, while we did the work in there.  Now he is unlikely to get much firewood out of if, but we do need to get in there to do more work, but he doesn’t want to lose the grazing in there.  I can understand he has got a living to make, but ideally there is lots more work I could do in there.  I have found hares and all sorts in there that are not abundant in the Water Park.  Other sites that I’ve done coppicing on at South Cerney are along the disused railway line, a very nice corridor, there are some very nice sedge beds up near the Spine Road railway arches car park.  We plan to go in there; there are some unusual flowers such as the lodden lily in there that need attention.  The willow is dominating too much in there so that is on the next winter’s work programme, so if we can get English Nature to provide some money for us to do that.  It’s coming down to money very much these days, it didn’t used to, we used to carry on in our own sweet way and do our good deeds as we saw them, but now we need to be able to justify doing it from a financially viable view point, so things like Cerney Wick copse we really want to get back in there.</P>

</B><LI>Biodiversity is a buzzword at the moment; we are really leading the way by writing our biodiversity action plan. We started about 4 or 5 years ago now and it’s all apropos the Rio summit in 1993, I believe it was, we started about 4 years ago, writing actin plans for specific habitats and species, they may have been birds or insects they were particular plants, they were particular habitats. But if you take a specific creature and provide the best possible habits for it, you will also benefit a lot of other creatures.  This was the thinking, that you aim on a few target species such as otters and bitterns and unusual over-wintering birds and really make the best of the habitat for them then you will generally improve the area.  So it came out of the very weighty tome the biodiversity action plan and now we are implementing the action plan and we have recently appointed a implementation officer, someone called Simon Pickering, who used to work at Slimbridge and he’s now really singing my song, in that he is really able to grab hold of issues and make progress in getting some action.  We are there to implement the management requirements, the copsing, the reed bed management whatever, and then take things forward, so that really is quite an important new aspect of things in the Water park that we have now got someone who can now carry the cause forward, and I’m hoping to see good progress in the next few years because of Simon and to get much more of the conservation work done that I’ve dreamed about for a number of years.  So it’s now a best seller in conservation circles, our biodiversity action plan, and we are posting them off to all corners of the UK and abroad, as an example of how to do it, so we are quite proud of our little bap.</LI></OL>

<LI>I did a 3-year course at ….? Agricultural College down in Surrey and that had 2 sandwich placements.  The first summer I worked on a reservoir in South Wales ….? Then I worked for a summer and a winter in the Lake District, following that I spent a couple of years travelling and then ended up here.  This has really been my first proper job, and I expected to stay here 3 or 4 years, and 15 years on I’ve got no plans to move.  I’ve set up a very happy house in South Cerney and Catherine, who I met in the Lake District and the 2 children are all very happy in the area, so no particular plans to move.  Things have changed here but that’s life and we have a new taskmaster that we will play the game according to his rules and we will go forward.</LI></OL>

<LI>On this table here we’ve got a septarium nodule found in the South Cerney area on the barn ground landfill site, calcium deposited within the nodule is often very large round some boulder nodules about that height and often they contain nothing, but geologists expend a lot of energy cracking these things open and sometimes get rewarded with ammonites and all sorts inside them.  That I think is the correct information on that but I’m not a geologist.  However, in front here of more interest to my way of thinking, is the shoulder blade of a woolly mammoth, there have been woolly mammoths and all sorts of sabre tooth tigers skulls and ichthyosaur dorsal ribs and humerus in this block here.  So all sorts of creatures would have roamed around this area, or to be more precise the North of the Cotswolds and these things would have been washed down as the glaciers melted, washed away with all the stones and sand that were deposited in the upper Thames area that would have formed the gravel that has been dug in the Water Park now so thanks to the glaciers melting we’ve got all sorts of amazing creatures, lots of ammonites.  A little further along we have got some small ammonites, but there have been ammonites over 50cm across found in the Water Park and things that nobody expected to find here.  Things that have only been found in China before or Poland, and it’s really a prime site for fossils now</LI></OL>

<B><P>A13.07&#9;</B>These woolly mammoths had enormous tusks that we perhaps all remember from our school books, and in the Water Park we have found about this height, some of the tusks that have been found with the curving shape to them and really beautiful things.</P>
