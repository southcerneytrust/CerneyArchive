<B><U><P>INTERVIEW WITH KATY DEACON</P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
</U><P>Q 43.12&#9;</B>Can I ask you your name?</P>
<B><P>A 43.13&#9;</B>Katy Deacon</P>
<B>
<P>Q 43.16</B>&#9;Where were you born?</P>
<B><P>A 43.17</B>&#9;I was born in Northampton, but we moved to South Cerney when I was about 6 months old.</P>

<B><P>Q 43.23</B>&#9;So you spent your whole childhood here?  Did you go to Ann Edwards School?</P>
<B><P>A 43.28</B>&#9;Yes, I went to Ann Edwards School, before it was all knocked down and turned into what it is now.</P>

<B><P>Q 43.35</B>&#9;Did you enjoy it?</P>
<B><P>A 43.36</B>&#9;I loved it, well not to start with because I was a bit of a mummy’s girl, but I did enjoy my time there.  After that I went to Kingshill School, which is one of the two schools in Cirencester, when you finish primary school there is a choice.  It was Deer Park or Kingshill and Deer Park was far too big for me, so I chose to go to Kingshill which was much smaller.</P>

<B><P>Q 44.10</B>&#9;Did you make any friends there?</P>
<B><P>A 44.12</B>&#9;Yes I made lots of friends at Kingshill and I’m still in touch with a friend that I made at Ann Edwards, those are my oldest friends.  I’ve made friends all over the place.</P>

<B><P>Q 44.27</B>&#9;What was special about living in South Cerney as a child?</P>
<B><P>A 44.30</B>&#9;I loved growing up in South Cerney, all my friends were here, school was here and you could run around and be safe here, and everybody knows everybody here, that’s something about South Cerney that as you’re a teenager that’s not such a hot point, but when you’re younger it’s lovely running around in fields and having your friends round and being safe more than anything I think, that is what I value, looking back.  </P>

<B><P>Q 45.08</B>&#9;What did you do after you left Kingshill?</P>
<B><P>A 45.10</B>&#9;After I left Kingshill I went to Cirencester College to do my A levels, in French, German and English Literature.  I started art as well, but 4 A levels was a bit much so I just did the 3.  That was 2 years doing A levels and then after that I went to University in Exeter doing French and German combined honours degree and I’m just about to go off to Vienna for a year as part of the course.</P>

<B><P>Q 45.43&#9;</B>Are you looking forward to that?</P>
<B><P>A 45.44</B>&#9;Scared more than anything, no it’ll be fine, speaking German.</P>

<B><P>Q 45.51</B>&#9;Have you been abroad much?</P>
<B><P>A 45.53</B>&#9;Yes with school I’ve been on three exchanges, 2 German and 1 French.  I was a member of the Guides in South Cerney and I did quite a lot of travelling with them, I went to Austria and Brecon, different camps.</P>

<B><P>Q 46.15</B>&#9;Do you enjoy travelling?</P>
<B><P>A 46.17</B>&#9;I love travelling, yes, love it.</P>

<B><P>Q 46.21</B>&#9;What do you like about it?</P>
<B><P>A 46.22</B>&#9;I enjoy seeing other cultures and how people live and meeting people.</P>

<B><P>Q 46.31</B>&#9;Do you like music at all?</P>
<B><P>A 46.32</B>&#9;I’ve stuck with what I’ve liked from an early age I think, a group of three bands I’m into, stuck with.</P>

<B><P>Q 46.50&#9;</B>Do you sing?</P>
<B><P>A 46.51</B>&#9;Not so much now. I used to sing in the choirs at school and college, the chamber choir.</P>

<B><P>Q 47.13</B>&#9;Did you enjoy that?</P>
<B><P>A 47.14</B>&#9;Yes I did </P>

<B><P>Q 47.15</B>&#9;Pop and classical?</P>
<B><P>A 17.16</B>&#9;Pop and classical, yes.  Just branching into classical, just now, it’s something I’m discovering, much to my father’s delight.</P>

<B><P>Q 47.27</B>&#9;When you go to Vienna are you looking forward to the music there?</P>
<B><P>A 47.32</B>&#9;Yes, the home of classical music.</P>

<B><P>Q 47.43</B>&#9;When you are with your friends, what do you like to do in the area here?</P>
<B><P>A 47.55</B>&#9;I’m not actually in the area anymore, but when I was growing up here, when I was a teenager, I had a small group of close friends and we would spend our time at each other’s houses and walking and going our and wandering around, and as we came of age we used the village pubs and stuff like that, but what I notice now is lots of youngsters just hag around the streets in South Cerney because it is getting so much bigger and there’s not really anything to do in the evening for teenagers.  When I was that age it didn’t really matter that there wasn’t anything to do here, because there weren’t that many teenagers, so we’d just go to each other’s houses and watch TV and talk and stuff like that. We wouldn’t be out on the streets, not as much as people are now.</P>

<B><P>Q 49.09</B>&#9;Why do you think kids hang around apart from lack of motivation and anything interesting to do?</P>
<B><P>A 49.17</B>&#9;I don’t know I think it’s a bit of a shame, because there are so many other things there could be doing rather than sitting on a bench just watching the traffic go by, but I suppose they see it as somewhere to be seen, they can establish some sort of territory, I don’t know what it’s about, but I think it would be a lot safer if they were inside, because it’s not really the done thing I think, they should be doing something else.  </P>

<B><P>Q 50.00</B>&#9;Now you’re at Exeter, what societies do you belong to now you are at University?</P>
<B><P>A 50.08</B>&#9;I don’t belong to any societies at University.  I’m automatically in the French and German societies, so I have stuff to do with them, but general interests, I went along to a couple of choir sessions, but it’s all quite expensive, because you have to put down deposits for your music, and anything that you borrow and it’s all quite silly so we make our own entertainment.  I have just come out of a house living with seven other people so like was like a little society in itself, so we made our own entertainment.</P>

<B><P>Q 50.54</B>&#9;So what do you do……………………………….?</P>
<B><P>A 50.58</B>&#9;We enjoy cooking, we do a lot of cooking amongst ourselves, and dinner parties and things like that, a lot of the time it’s just getting in a couple of bottles of wine and sitting around talking till all hours, it’s a good way of getting to know people better/</P>

<B><P>Q 51.22</B>&#9;Do you think young people start relationships too early these days.</P>
<B><P>A 51.27</B>&#9;I think so, yes.  Probably on a more intimate level, I’ve had friendships with people from a very early age, so they are long standing relationships but not like boyfriend/girlfriend relationships. boyfriend/girlfriend relationships for me is something that has come along much later, because I have placed more emphasis on friendships I think I feel more secure in friendships than in relationships definitely, and I value them a hell of a lot more I think, they’re much more stable and something that you can rely on for a lot longer.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>A 52.24</B>&#9;I was a member of both the Brownies and the Guides in South Cerney, both of which I really enjoyed, it was great fun.  In the Brownies Enid Chubb was Brown Owl and it was every Wednesday afternoon and we would all go along and skip round the toadstool and play games. Most of my friends were there as well, so it was a way of keeping us entertained and it was something to look forward to on Wednesday afternoon and we would go away and do the badges, and then after Brownies it was Guides with Anne Garnett, that was more fun because it was much more grown up and you’d go camping, and that was something we all enjoyed, and again it was for me it was all girls of my age in the village who I’d grown up with anyway, so we’d go along and have a laugh, run around and play rounders  and go out and camp and loved it,  cooking outside as well, that was fun.</P>

<B><P>Q 53.33</B>&#9;Are you interested in nature?</P>
<B><P>A 53.36</B>&#9;I used to be really into horses, and I’d go riding a bit but not much, before that it was ballet.  I’m very interested in children, and I have done a lot of babysitting in the village, which is another way of knowing people and be trusted with looking after their children, so I did a lot of that before University, that was my main earner I think, babysitting, and I’ve worked with children as well.   I’ve spent the last 2 years working at the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester over the summer, looking after Italian children that come over and arranging programmes for them, which is tiring, but very rewarding.</P>

<B><P>Q 54.37</B>&#9;What did you think of the Louise Woodward case?</P>
<B><P>A 54.39</B>&#9;It was a nightmare.  I didn’t know what to think because I didn’t know much of the background on it.  I was worried that it turned into an England versus America type thing, and because she is British we were saying she is innocent and we want her home.  I just don’t know what I would do in something like that.  When you are working with children you do have to be very careful and they can stress you out and you can get annoyed and it would be very easy to snap and do something that could be fatal.</P>

<B><P>Q 55.21</B>&#9;Once you’ve got your languages at Exeter, what are you hoping to do?</P>
<B><P>A 55.26</B>&#9;I don’t know.  I’m hoping to travel and with the work I’ve been doing with the Italian children over the summer, I’ve been in an assistant management position, so I’ve got quite a good stead in that company.  But I would like to go on and do a TEFL or something like that, so I could teach and I would like to travel more than anything, so I hope to get a teaching qualification and use that to travel around and see some of the world.  I don’t know what I would like to do at the end of it all.  I don’t know what I will settle down into doing, but I would like to teach and travel.</P>

<B><P>Q 56.16</B>&#9;Do you go to church?</P>
<B><P>A 56.20</B>&#9;Not on a regular basis any more.  I used to when I was a member of Youth Fellowship in the village. But that’s something that’s got a little bit weal over the last couple of years, with everything else that’s been happening.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 56.42</B>&#9;As  you’ve been growing up the Water Park has been growing too, what do you think about all the gravel and stuff?</P>
<B><P>A 56.48</B>&#9;What’s left behind them is usually OK.  I used to go to Keynes Park when I was younger, it was what we used to call South Cerney seaside, but I was a bit put out by all the developments with the Water Mark with all the pastel shades huts appearing everywhere and all the clientele that would be bringing in; all the rich people with their weekend homes in the Cotswolds.  I thought that was a bit off, I wasn’t too happy about that, but they are making the most out of it I suppose which is something that is good for the village in a way.  It’s just more traffic and more development and that is something that quite astounding about the village in the last couple of years the amount of development that has been going on.  When we moved to the village the area behind where I live in The Lennards, Box Bush, that used to be just fields and you used to be able to walk over the fields and pick elderflowers and things like that, but now it is just houses, and the latest ones down by the lake at the bottom, the new houses there, and it’s amazing how many houses they are managing to fit in.  </P>

<B><P>Q 58.22</B>&#9;What do you think of the Franklin Way………………..?</P>
<B><P>A 58.27</B>&#9;I remember when they built the first lot of houses there, they went over what used to be a BMX track where we used to go round and ride on our bikes when we were little and it was a fight then to keep the area that they developed on down and now they are going to – that’s the only play area, I don’t think it needs to be developed, I think there’s enough.</P>

<B><P>Q 58.58</B>&#9;Do you think children need more space?</P>
<B><P>A 59.00</B>&#9;Definitely.  I think that the village is being developed as a phenomenal  rate, it needs to slow down at least and perhaps even stop, because South Cerney is huge to be a village, it could be a town, but the amount of green area we have here we want to keep it.  Children need green areas and safe places to run around and be in nature and I had that when I was growing up here as a child and I want other children to have it as well. </P>

<B><P>Q 59.42</B>&#9;Do you think there are enough shops in South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 59.47</B>&#9;That’s an area, the shopping in South Cerney is quite restricted, there aren’t many changes really they have always been the same, the shops in Clark’s Hay, and that’s it and with all the development in Cirencester with the supermarkets I’m sure the majority of inhabitants in South Cerney do their shopping in Cirencester then drive back to South Cerney.  And it is handy in Cirencester, so maybe there wouldn’t be that much call for it, but it would be something that could be developed.  I think it should be to keep the business in South Cerney rather than Cirencester.</P>

<B><P>Q 00.02</B>&#9;If there were more shops in South Cerney, what sort of shops would you like to see?</P>
<B><P>A 00.05</B>&#9;I don’t spend that much time in South Cerney as I am at University for the majority of the time, but from what I can gather I think general shops, there is a green grocers and a Londis shop, similar things along that line, maybe, or maybe just expand the ones that are in existence, so that they have more products available.  There is a chemist, which is fine.</P>

<B><P>Q 00.57</B>&#9;What do you rely on for transport?</P>
<B><P>A 01.00</B>&#9;Transport wise I  use the buses when I’m here, they’ve got better, the are more frequent now, there are buses on the hour into Cirencester.  But lots of times it’s the car when I can get if off mother, I use the car or walk, because if I am going to see people in the village, it’s all within walking distance, it’s fine.  </P>

<B><P>Q 01.32</B>&#9;What about late night transport?</P>
<B><P>A 01.34</B>&#9;I either rely on friends, or get the car and use that.</P>

<B><P>Q 01.46</B>&#9;Do you think we could do with some better cinemas in the area?</P>
<B><P>A 01.50</B>&#9;Yes.  Definitely the only decent cinema is in Swindon, the one in Cirencester is appalling, it’s 2 screen and what somebody I babysit for calls the fleapit, so they are not anything amazing.  There has been talk I think about doing the one up in Cirencester or moving it to a different plot, I thing that would be very welcome.</P>

<B><P>Q 02.36</B>&#9;To my generation, keeping something in your eyebrow is just not on, especially when you are a pretty girl already.</P>
<B><P>A 02.44</B>&#9;The eyebrow ring,  I like it I think it’s pretty and its something different, I suppose it’s my little rebellion in a way.  I’d run out of places in my ears, so I went for he eyebrow, maybe the lip next.  My mum didn’t speak to me for about half an hour when I came home with it, she just looked at me.  But I like it and I wouldn’t be without it now. I love it.  I think it’s the only one in the village as well.  </P>

<B><P>Q 04.16</B>&#9;How would you like to see South Cerney develop in the future?</P>
<B><P>A 04.24</B>&#9;In the future, I think I’d probably like to see an end to all the expansion I think and maybe concentrate on bettering the areas that need it, maybe down by the school, that area where the flats are, they’re not to nice, I think they should be developed and I’d lie to see the children doing a lot more.  When I was young, maybe it was something to do with South Cerney not being so big, and there was more of a village spirit, but definitely the youngsters need something to do.  Maybe Brownies and Guides doesn’t work anymore, but when we were little it was fantastic and I don’t see any reason why it should stop working, it’s just not cool anymore I suppose.  I’d like to see the kids doing something in a much better state I think.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 06.08</B>&#9;Don’t you think teenagers could organise their own entertainment..?</P>
<B><P>A 06.12</B>&#9;Probably, but I suppose they don’t feel that they are trusted, they don’t feel they are given a chance, because whenever I’m home and I’m driving round the village, if I’m coming back from town they are just hanging out on the streets, and when kids are hanging around with nothing to do that’s when stuff happens.  There has been trouble, and a lot of it has been because they have got nothing else to do.  I think teenagers are sensible they can arrange something to keep them entertained it’s just hoping it doesn’t involve anything illegal, or something that’s going to cause trouble.  But if there is something arranged that they could enjoy that they could go along to then I think that would be good.  It’s just finding something that interests them I think.</P>

<B><P>Q 07.26</B>&#9;Should there be anymore police presence in the village?</P>
<B><P>A 07.29</B>&#9;I was never aware of any police presence when I was younger, but now, if I’ve been coming home late, I’ve noticed that there are a lot of police cars driving round the village, which is good because if there is anything happening then they are here to see that it’s stopped, but I think it’s a shame that it has come to that.  Maybe there should be police presence, but I would like it if there didn’t have to be.</P>

<B><P>Q 08.15</B>&#9;Do you think the young find in provocative?</P>
<B><P>A 08.23</B>&#9;It might not be a daredevil situation, it enforces the fact that they are not trusted, because they are being watched, and if they feel they are being watched they feel hemmed in and they are more likely to feel aggressive and see the police as something that’s not for the good of society but something that is just repressing them, and that’s how it all gets bitter and twisted and nasty.</P>
