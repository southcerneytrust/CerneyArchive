<B><U><P>INTERVIEW WITH FRANCES CHAPMAN</P>

</B></U><FONT SIZE=2><P>Tape 23</P>
</FONT><B><U>
</U><FONT SIZE=2><P>Q 25.49&#9;</B>Where were you born?</P>
<B><P>A 25.50&#9;</B>Whittinger(?) which is near Sapperton.  We moved to Cerney Wick when I was 2.  I lived in Armour Lane for a while before that.  I don’t know how old I was when we moved from Whittinger.  My father worked for the Co-op, he was cowman at Westfield Farm.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 26.23</B>&#9;How big an area………………………?</P>
<B><P>A 26.30</B>&#9;Now or then?  Most of it apart from the farms in the village, all of Down Ampney and Latton were Co-op farms.</P>

<B><P>Q 26.44</B>&#9;Do you know when they set up the Creamery?</P>
<B><P>A 26.46</B>&#9;I’ve no idea, as far as I’m concerned, that’s always been there.</P>

<B><P>Q 26.55</B>&#9;Where did you go to school?</P>
<B><P>A 26.57</B>&#9;South Cerney, then Cirencester Grammar School.</P>

<B><P>Q 27.03</B>&#9;Were you in the old school, can you describe it?</P>
<B><P>A 27.06</B>&#9;It had 3 rooms, always very pleasant, a wonderful headmaster, I’ve got vivid memories of him in the winter, throwing buckets of water down the playground at night if it was frosty then joining in with the children in the morning, going down the slide.</P>

<B><P>Q 27.29</B>&#9;How strict were they?</P>
<B><P>A 27.31</B>&#9;Very strict.  I think it was necessary.</P>

<B><P>Q 27.42</B>&#9;Where they very high spirited children?</P>
<B><P>A 27.49</B>&#9;Yes but in different ways to what they are today, much different ways.  I think they knew how to make their own entertainment then, there was no television, so we had to make our own entertainment, which I think is better.</P>

<B><P>Q 28.12</B>&#9;Did you enjoy the countryside?</P>
<B><P>A 28.15</B>&#9;Oh yes, it was freedom, it’s something that children don’t have today. We’d go out in the morning and didn’t come back till night perhaps, unless we were hungry.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 28.31</B>&#9;How did you get to school?</P>
<B><P>A 28.33</B>&#9;To start with I was taken on the back of my mother’s bicycle, unti I was old enough to ride a bike myself, and then I can remember taking one boy on the back of my bike to school, when I was about 9 or 10, and if you could see him now you wouldn’t think that he would do that.  </P>

<B><P>Q 28.58</B>&#9;What about the old walkways?</P>
<B><P>A 29.00</B>&#9;Most of the original footpaths have disappeared because of the pits, or lakes as people call them now, I still call them pits.</P>

<B><P>Q 29.25</B>&#9;Do you remember walking a great deal?</P>
<B><P>A 29.29</B>&#9;Oh yes.  We used to go all over the place, and at certain times of the year you could pick violets in one place and cowslips in another and water bubbles in another.  It was a very good childhood.</P>

<B><P>Q 29.49</B>&#9;Question about natural history</P>
<B><P>A 30.02</B>&#9;I’m not quite sure about that,  some of it will be all right and some of it won’t perhaps.  </P>

<B><P>Q 30.13</B>&#9;What did you do in later years……………….?</P>
<B><P>A 30.17</B>&#9;I worked in the office of a shop in the Market Place, it’s not there now, it’s a building society.  I was there for 2 years, and then I went to Swindon to work, because I wanted a motorbike and I left my job in Cirencester, took a job in Swindon and cycled to Swindon every day, hoping that my mother would have sympathy with me and let me have a motorbike, which she did after six months.</P>

<B><P>Q 30.57</B>&#9;How old were you?</P>
<B><P>A 30.58</B>&#9;19</P>

<B><P>Q 31.02</B>&#9;Did you save up for it?</P>
<B><P>A 31.03</B>&#9;Yes.  </P>

<B><P>Q 31.04</B>&#9;And what was it?</P>
<B><P>A 31.06</B>&#9;It was a 1953 Francis Barnett Falcon 54.</P>

<B><P>Q 31.13</B>&#9;Where did your interest in motorbikes…………..?</P>
<B><P>A 31.17</B>&#9;Swindon Speedway I think, that’s where I first saw bikes to any extent.</P>

<B><P>Q 31.29</B>&#9;Did you go there on a regular basis?</P>
<B><P>A 31.31</B>&#9;Oh yes, every Saturday and sometimes if Swindon were riding at Oxford, we would go to Oxford.</P>

<B><P>Q 31.38</B>&#9;…………?</P>
<B><P>A 31.43</B>&#9;I had a boyfriend from London then, who had a motorbike as well and he was a speedway fanatic as well, and whenever I used to go to London I used to go to the clubs up there as well.</P>

<B><P>Q 31.54</B>&#9;How did you meet?</P>
<B><P>A 31.57</B>&#9;He had a relative near here</P>

<B><P>Q 32.04</B>&#9;You had a lot to do with South Cerney playgroup</P>
<B><P>A 32.06</B>&#9;Yes my daughter started the playgroup the first day it opened and that was at 12 Edwards College, and the grass needed cutting around the building and I volunteered to cut the grass and that’s what started me off.  Because I had volunteered to do something they grabbed me to go on the committee, and after about 18 months I was Assistant Supervisor, and went on from there, I was there for 27 years. </P>

<B><P>Q 32.42</B>&#9;Tell me what………………..?</P>
<B><P>A 31.47</B>&#9;I can’t remember exactly how many years we were in the College, but the Diocese decided that they wanted to sell the houses, so we had to get out, we did find land and found an old building, but had to find temporary accommodation, and Mr Fenton kindly let us have his dining room for a term, which must have been absolutely chaotic in the house, but we enjoyed it, it was the summer term, the weather was quite good so we were able to get out a lot.  Before we moved down to Berkeley Close by the Scout hut, and we were down there several years before we moved to the another building where it is now in the School.</P>

<B><P>Q 33.37</B>&#9;………………involved a lot of money…………………..?</P>
<B><P>A 33.42</B>&#9;It was hard work fundraising, we had one big fundraising session at the Summer Fayre, in the field opposite the college, and we had a TV star to open it, luckily she was an aunt of twins we had at the playgroup at the time, Kate Williams.  The committee organised it, but it was always very hard work on the day, start early in the morning until late in the afternoon and jumble sales and various things, I did some sponsored rides, I rode with the Rockers’ Reunion, from London to Brighton and raised nearly £700.  It’s a matter of teamwork.</P>

<B><P>Q 34.57</B>&#9;What other bicycles ………………..?</P>
<B><P>A 35.00</B>&#9;BSA’s mainly.  My son has other Jap bikes, but he likes BSA’s as well so it’s a family thing.</P>

<B><P>Q 35.23</B>&#9;How did you meet your husband?</P>
<B><P>A 35.26</B>&#9;That was the boyfriend I had with the motorbike.</P>

<B><P>Q 35.34</B>&#9;And he came from London?</P>
<B><P>A 35.35</B>&#9;Yes.  </P>

<B><P>Q 35.38</B>&#9;What did he do?</P>
<B><P>A 35.40</B>&#9;He’s a trained electrician and also a trained telephone engineer, but when we moved down here from London he had to change his job completely and ended up as; they’re called the most hated men in industry, a time study engineer.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 36.01</B>&#9;What other links have you got with Cerney Wick?</P>
<B><P>A 36.08</B>&#9;My mother’s family and my father’s family have been here for a long time.  My grandfather owned the pub for a number of years, and an uncle had the mill.</P>

<B><P>Q 36.26</B>&#9;Do you remember them telling you any stories about Cerney Wick?</P>
<B><P>A 36.31</B>&#9;My mother could remember barges going up and down the canal as a child.</P>

<B><P>Q 36.40</B>&#9;Did she ever say how they got on with the barge folk?  </P>
<B><P>A 36.42</B>&#9;No not at all, she never said anything about that, but of course in those days they had to cycle everywhere, and I suppose Cirencester, Kemble Fairford, all round there, but in those days they never got further afield, not like we do today.</P>

<B><P>Q 37.08</B>&#9;Did they use the railway at all?</P>
<B><P>A 37.11</B>&#9;Yes I think so. I remember going on holiday to Bournemouth from South Cerney, it took about 7 hours I think, it seemed to stop at almost every gateway.</P>

<B><P>Q 37.27</B>&#9;Do you remember the war…………………..?</P>
<B><P>A 37.36</B>&#9;We had aerodromes all round us, there was Fairford, Down Ampney, Leigh, Kemble, Lyneham, so there was always plenty of activity around here and we did have several bombs dropped in the village, one was in the canal a few feet from the roundhouse, but the only damage it did there was to knock the chimney pot off.  The chimney pot was square and the blast went round the roundhouse, but just knocked the square chimney pot off, and I think that was the same night that the stained glass window was blown out of the church, but there was no other damage really apart from windows blown out. </P>

<B><P>Q 38.32</B>&#9;What about rationing and things like that?</P>
<B><P>A 38.34</B>&#9;Well it was not too bad really because we grew all our own vegetables and of course we used to eat rabbits a lot and pheasants.  We used to go out and get our own rabbits and pheasants and eels.  We used to get eels out of the river and trout.</P>

<B><P>Q 38.56</B>&#9;What about crayfish?</P>
<B><P>A 38.58</B>&#9;Yes but we never used to eat them.  Eels we used to eat from the river and trout, but nothing else.</P>

<B><P>Q 39.11</B>&#9;Inaudible question</P>
<B><P>A 39.15</B>&#9;Oh much.  And spent all our time in it in the summer, with or without bathing costumes.</P>

<B><P>Q 39.28</B>&#9;Can you remember anything about……………………..?</P>
<B><P>A 39.38</B>&#9;They always flooded in the winter.  The meadows by the side of the river always flooded in the winter.  Of course if it froze after that we used to spend out time on the ice.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 40.01</B>&#9;Can you outline the changes…………………………...?</P>
<B><P>A 40.13</B>&#9;The farms have gone for a start.  There has been a bit more building, not a lot, but it’s the farms that have gone, there are no farms left in the village at all now.  No animals, no cows going through the village.  We’ve got the stables now with horses, but that’s a shame that the farms have gone.  The village is no longer like an extended family; at one stage it was just perhaps two families in the village, the Rimes and the Smiths.  But not anymore.</P>

<B><P>Q 40.59</B>&#9;Which family were you from?</P>
<B><P>A 41.01</B>&#9;From the Rimes.</P>
<B><P>42.02&#9;</B>We used to have flower shows in the village and it started off with a fancy dress parade through the village to where the flower show and fete was being held and George Wheeler would lead off the procession with his squeeze box, he used to walk through the village with his squeeze box, not really in tune or any special tune, but he would play this through the village, which was great fun to us children, and his wife, I don’t really know quite what as wrong, but it was very difficult to understand her, whether she was tongue tied or what, but very difficult to understand, but we all loved Mrs Wheeler, and Bert was their son and he was another character always went round with a stick in his hand.  I did have a dog at one stage that hated him because of this stick he always carried with him.  He used to ring the bell for going to church at one stage, I think perhaps he rang it before I took over I don’t know, because I rang the bell for many years.  They used to say at one stage that I used to bring people into church, my mother drove them out and my father dug them in.  My mother played the organ and my father dug the graves.  </P>

<B><P>Q 43.40</B>&#9;……………………………..?</P>
<B><P>A 43.44</B>&#9;Oh yes, much.  It used to be full for most services.  There used to be two services every Sunday now I come to think of it, one in the morning and one in the evening.  There was an old coke boiler at the back, it stood about 3 feet high, and my mother used to get up at 4 o’clock in the morning sometimes to light this in the winter when it was very cold, and always when you went in for church if you sat at the back you were warm, if you sat at the back you were cold.  So the biggest part of the congregation would sit at the back near this enormous coke boiler, which I remember having a tortoise on the top in the black lead, slow but sure combustion round it.</P>

<B><P>Q 45.26</B>&#9;Where did the clergyman come from?</P>
<B><P>A 45.30</B>&#9;That was Reverend Kennon from South Cerney, and there was another lady from South Cerney who used to help play the organ at times, she used to cycle from South Cerney on Sundays.</P>

<B><P>Q 45.45</B>&#9;Do you remember anything of the Haddow family?</P>
<B><P>A 45.49</B>&#9;No.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 45.54</B>&#9;Do you remember any of the ladies from the College…………….?</P>
<B><P>A 45.59</B>&#9;Miss Macklin, she used to come and put pictures up in the church for Sunday school, we had a Mrs Smith who used to take Sunday school.  Miss Macklin used to ride a tricycle down to put pictures up for the Sunday school.  I don’t remember anyone else from the college.</P>

<B><P>Q 46.27</B>&#9;Mrs Waddington-Jones?</P>
<B><P>A 46.27</B>&#9;Oh yes, of course I knew Mr Waddington-Jones as well.  They were here for sometime.  Mrs Waddington-Jones used to come down and have coffee with us at the playgroup.</P>
<P>&#9;I remember Miss Hall, although I don’t know much about her, I remember the wonderful paintings that she did.  </P>

<B><P>Q47.00</B>&#9;In the schoolyard do you remember the old school house for the masters and mistresses?</P>
<B><P>A 47.12</B>&#9;It was quite big.  I remember going into the headmaster’s study in there, but apart from that I don’t remember much.  One thing I do remember is the air raid shelters in the playground.  We used to dive in when the air raid siren went.  They were made with enormous pipes from Redland Pipe factory and covered with turf, so they weren’t noticeable from the sky.  We used to go in there and sing songs.</P>

<B><P>Q 47.52</B>&#9;…………………………………?</P>
<B><P>A 47.55</B>&#9;I don’t remember that. I remember going in there and singing songs.</P>

<B><P>Q 48.09</B>&#9;Do you remember any particular shops in South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 48.11</B>&#9;I remember Mr Dorling’s.  That was just like one room down at the side of his house.  And I remember if we did any knitting at school, which was something we did quite a bit.  When we had finished the garment, we had to take it down to Mr Dorling to have it weighed, so they knew how much to charge our parents for the wool we’d used.  Mrs Pike at the Chemist’s, which is where Spuds and Buds was.  I don’t remember anything else.  I think there was something else round where Londis is now, but it was only a shack, it wasn’t a building like it is now, and of course Bradley’s has always been there as far as I’m concerned.</P>

<B><P>Q 49.17</B>&#9;You don’t remember Berkeley’s yard?</P>
<B><P>A 49.19</B>&#9;Oh yes.  That was in Silver Street, that was there, and of course Morgan’s the builders that was Upper Up, where Peyman’s Terrace is now, that’s the back of it, I don’t know what the front of it is called.  And the hairdresser, that was always there.  Miss Lane’s sweet shop opposite where the Post Office is now, and you’d go in there for a penny bag of sweets, and the Post Office was a grocer’s shop when I was a child.  Luker’s the grocer’s shop, and I think that went into a fish and chip shop for a while.  </P>

<B><P>Q 50.23</B>&#9;You don’t remember the old Post Office?</P>
<B><P>A 50.25</B>&#9;Oh yes.  Johnson’s, yes towards Upper Up.  That was the Post Office then, that was a very dark and dingy place to go into.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 51.04</B>&#9;How do you feel about the ………………………….?</P>
<B><P>A 51.10</B>&#9;I don’t like Water Mark, I think that’s hideous.  The first ones along Station Road they’re not so bad because they’re almost hidden now, but those along the Spine Road are terrible.  I hope this thing with Somerford Keynes never goes through or that will ruin Somerford Keynes.  </P>

<B><P>Q 51.51</B>&#9;How do you feel about the exploitation of the gravel workings?</P>
<B><P>A 52.16</B>&#9;I think some of it should have been given back to local people to use as their own recreation area, which I think would have been good for South Cerney and Cerney Wick.  I can remember many years ago Hills wanting to dig out Church Piece, and I think my husband and I were the only ones in the village who said yes to it, everyone else disagreed with it, but I think now if we’d had Church Piece just as a lake for the village for children to swim in or learn to sail on it would have been ideal.  I do think the villages could have been given a lake for their own use.</P>

<B><P>Q 53.13</B>&#9;How do you feel about the whole Water Park, Lechlade as well, do you think we’re becoming like the Norfolk Broads? </P>
<B><P>A 53.24</B>&#9;I think that would spoil the whole area completely if it is over-commercialised .  It would ruin it for everyone.</P>

<B><P>Q 53.36</B>&#9;You’ve got very nice tranquil walks………………………….?</P>
<B><P>A 53.43</B>&#9;Yes.  There are still some nice walks, and the walk along the side of the canal is very good, even though you can hear the noise from the new road, especially on a hot day when you are walking under what I call the tunnel, where the trees go over the top. It’s lovely.</P>

<B><P>Q 54.03</B>&#9;How do you feel about the new road?</P>
<B><P>A 54.08</B>&#9;I hate the noise of it, the road itself I think is great, for people who want to get from A to B quickly, but I think they should do something about the surface.  A concrete surface is no good at all for residents nearby.  I’ve recently had some work done on the house and had to sleep in a bedroom at the back of the house and to try and sleep in hot weather with the windows closed is awful, because the noise goes continuously through the night.</P>

<B><U><P>PICTURE</P>

</U><P>54.54&#9;</B>Looking through photograph album</P>
<B><P>55.20&#9;</B>Hunting plate</P>
<B>
<P>55.55</B>&#9;We used to rehearse spring and summer, sketches and songs, and in the autumn we used to give a show in Cerney Wick village hall, and we used to go round to Kempsford, Ashton Keynes, South Cerney, wherever there was a village hall that we could get into, we would take this concert party round.  Hire a coach and go round to different villages, we used to have a wonderful time.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 56.27</B>&#9;What kind of sketches did you do?</P>
<B><P>A  56.33</B>&#9;It was always very humourous, I can remember doing the wedding of the painted doll and the vicar used to pull such faces that we were all in stitches as well as the audience.</P>

<B><P>Q 56.52</B>&#9;Did you make them up yourselves?</P>
<B><P>A 56.55</B>&#9;Yes.  Always had something local in it.  Chum Steel(?) was the main one who did most of the writing, lived in the village at the time. And of course there were one or two old people in the village who could say long monologues.  Of course it’s a shame as they’ve died, these things have died as well.</P>

</FONT><B><U><P>&nbsp;</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;</P>
</U><P>A 00.02&#9;</B>Four times actually, we started off in a caravan at the other end of the village and we were moved from there; we came to this ground which belonged to my grandfather and the Council wouldn’t let us a build a house here at that time, so we bought a house at the other end of the village, an then one morning when a man appeared at the bottom of the garden doing something in the field, I went out and asked him what he as doing because he had measuring equipment and I got rather suspicious and he said they were getting ready to dig it out for gravel.  When my husband came home I told him and he said we’ll get the plans out for the house again, so we tried for the plans for a house here and they went through that time, so we moved back to this end of the village and we’ve been here 31 years.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 01.06</B>&#9;Did you have your children in the village?</P>
<B><P>A 01.08</B>&#9;Yes.  They were born in the house we lived in at the other end of the village, one is still at home part time, that’s my son and our daughter lives down by  Lewes, down by Brighton, she is a Departmental Manager for Social Services.  They both are bikers, Brian had a moped when he was 16 to help him get into the 6<SUP>th</SUP> form at odd times.  He went on to a BSA after that.  Elaine had no interest in bikes, she was horse mad until she was 16, then she suddenly said she wanted a motorbike, she was lucky she didn’t have the battle that I had.  We tried to get her to have a moped at 16, and she wouldn’t so she saved up and bought a motorbike before her 17<SUP>th</SUP> birthday.  Every night we used to take her down to the old railway track to give her lesson before she went on the road at 17 and she passed her test before Brain did.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 02.26</B>&#9;Tell us a little bit more about the battle you had………..?</P>
<B><P>A 02.29&#9;</B>About getting a motorbike?  Well it actually took me 2 years to get round my mother, my father had no say in it.  My mother said I couldn’t have it and it took me two years to get round her and I actually had to change my job and move from Cirencester to Swindon.   I cycled 30 miles a day, working two jobs, I used to work in the evening at the NAAFI on Cerney Camp to get more money to buy my motorbike.  My first motorbike cost be £112, the one I have just bought cost nearly £3,000, so that is the difference.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 03.10</B>&#9;Do you think your mother’s prejudice was because of the reputation of bikers in those days?</P>
<B><P>A 03.14&#9;</B>No, girls just didn’t do that sort of thing, that’s what it was.  Because I wasn’t allowed to do so many things because I was a girl. </P>
<B>




<P>Q 03.24</B>&#9;&#9;Did you have brothers and sisters?</P>




<B><P>A 03.26</B>&#9;Yes, two brothers, and they could do anything, but I couldn’t because I was a girl, I even had to fight to get to Grammar School, my brothers didn’t go, so why should I?  </P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 03.42</B>&#9;You qualified at school to go to the Grammar School, the 11+ was it?</P>
<B><P>A 03.51&#9;</B>I don’t think it was called the 11+, it was the Grammar School entrance examination, which everyone took prior to their 11<SUP>th</SUP> birthday.  You passed A B or C, if you passed A, you went free, if you passed B you paid so much, and if you passed C you paid a bit more.  I passed C and I think my mother paid for me for two terms, and then free education came in, I don’t remember what she paid, it was probably quite a lot in those days.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 04.58</B>&#9;She worked……………..?</P>
<B><P>A 05.00</B>&#9;Yes.  She was called up for war work, I don’t know how old I was, but I can remember her saying she lost a brother in the First World War, and she said she always wanted to do something worthwhile and she worked in a munitions factory in Cirencester, opposite Wooworths, it think it was called the GPA, for a long time until she nearly lost a finger, then she still wanted to do something which she felt was worthwhile, so she worked in the NAAFI on Cerney Camp as well.  That’s how I came to go there part time, because I worked there under age, you weren’t allowed to go into the NAAFI until you were 18, but because my mother was there they let me go in at 17.  We used to cycle up there.  She worked split shifts, she used to work there in the morning, came home and did her housework in the afternoon and then went back in the evening.  I worked 5 evenings a week.</P>
<B>
<P>A 06.05</B>&#9;……………..cheap………..?</P>
<B><P>A 06.07</B>&#9;Oh yes, especially when I had by motorbike, I only had it six weeks before I took my test, and they had bets on that I wouldn’t pass my test, of course they didn’t know that I had ridden one before I actually bought my bike, and I shocked them all when I passed my test after 6 weeks.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 06.29</B>&#9;Do you remember the dances……………………..?</P>
<B><P>A 06.33&#9;</B>We were all serving on the bar then, they used to have big dances in the hangars with well-known bands from the radio, fantastic nights they were.</P>

<P>Q 06.54&#9;</B>&#9;Do you remember them all going off ………………..?</P>




<B><P>A 06.55</B>&#9;I don’t remember that, that was before my time on the camp.  I can remember the gliders from Down Ampney that went off.  Dozens and dozens of them, we used to watch them go off.</P>

<P>Q 07.21</B>&#9;What were your feeling when……………………..?</P>
<B><P>A 07.24</B>&#9;Well as children we didn’t realise what it all meant, in hindsight we did but it was just excitement watching these gliders go off.  And of course all the airborne men were under canvas in the field opposite the Creamery. Something else I just remembered I used to go with an old fellow in the village, Reg Smith, who used to keep pigs, he used to go up with his pony and trap and collect swill for the pigs.  I used to go and ride on the trap with him.  It was in the field opposite the crossroads, the first field on the left as you go towards Down Ampney, the airborne troops were there under canvas.  All the gliders were based at Down Ampney then.  We used to hold whist drives and dances in the village hall here.  My grandfather used to organise the whist drives, and after the whist drives were finished, we used to have a dance and Robin Haynes, who was blind, used to come from Latton with his two sisters.  And robin used to play the piano, we used to have a wonderful time in the village hall with the dancing, and of course people would come up from the pub, when the pub as closed.  To look at the village hall now, you wouldn’t think it was possible, but we had wonderful times in there.  And that went on for a long time after the war.  </P>

<B><P>Q 09.35</B>&#9;Did you have people coming back from Korea?</P>
<B><P>A 09.38</B>&#9;No.  It was only World at II. I don’t remember as far back as that.  I can remember when the first extension was put on I should imagine I wasn’t very old then, perhaps at the beginning of the war, perhaps when the brewery bought it off my grandfather that when the first extension, I can’t remember when the first extension was put on but that made quite a bit of difference and of course the second extension that’s been put on recently has improved it so much , the trade is so much better now.  I always said it was a gold mine, if it had the right people in it, it’s obviously got the right people in it now. </P>

<P>Q 10.57</B>&#9;Is there very much…………………the villagers themselves?</P>
<B><P>A 11.04&#9;</B>A lot of the villagers use it yes but I don’t think there is the<B> </B>community<B> </B>spirit in villages today as there used to be years ago.  I think if there was a crisis in a family everyone would get together and help, but I think real community spirit I don’t think is there anymore.  I think it is probably the same in South Cerney.  South Cerney I think is each estate has its own little community, which I suppose is a good thing.</P>

<P>Q 12.03&#9;</B>What do you think about metal detector people who find things and attempt to sell them abroad?</P>
<B>
<P>A 12.15</B>&#9;I’ve never heard of anything like that I’ve seen metal detectors on beaches where people go found looking for money that has been dropped, but I’ve not heard of anyone recently.  We always used to say finders keepers, but I think if it is something of national interest it should be declared, not just try and make money out of it for themselves.  </P>
<B><P>&#9;</B>I think it’s townies coming to country that’s ruining country life. I think there are probably a lot of people that would agree with that, townies coming to the country ruin country life.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 13.37</B>&#9;Would you like to expand on that, is there a danger in South Cerney……?</P>
<B><P>A 13. 46</B>&#9;I don’t know I’ve not really heard anyone speak fiercely about it, but I’ve said to Helen Dorling about it, and she agrees with me, and the odd one or two, but nothing said really forcefully about it.  It’s just my own opinion.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 14.14</B>&#9;…………………..second homes…………………..?</P>
<B><P>A 14.18</B>&#9;Oh yes.  I think this is a problem they come in and they think country life is idyllic, and they don’t want the noise.  I mean we’ve not had it here, but in some parts of the country where the cockerels are crowing early in the morning and they want them stopped, I think that is ridiculous.  </P>
<B><P>&#9;</B>Would never want to ride, whereas my daughter did she liked the horses. </P>
<P> If you go along the old A419 you can see openings on the airfield out on to the old A419.  They weren’t just to come out on to the old A419, they were to put aeroplanes into fields on the other side of the road.   I think there were two fields there that used to have planes in them for several years and the traffic was always stopped so the planes could go backwards and forwards. I can remember that vividly.</P>

<B><P>A 17.42</B>&#9;I can remember in the war when the air raid siren went off Mr Burton from Hampton Villa, used to have to cycle round the village blowing a whistle so that everyone knew about the air raid and when the all clear went he had to cycle round the village shaking a hand bell so he was riding one-handed all the time, so that everyone knew it was safe to come out again.</P>

<B><P>Q 18.06</B>&#9;What about did deaf people do?</P>
<B><P>A 18.09</B>&#9;I don’t think that was ever thought of, someone would probably tell them.</P>

<B><P>Q 18.18</B>&#9;Were there any particular celebrations?&#9;</P>
<B><P>A 18.20</B>&#9;I think we had a party and sports, I don’t think there was anything other than that, I think we probably joined in with South Cerney.</P>
