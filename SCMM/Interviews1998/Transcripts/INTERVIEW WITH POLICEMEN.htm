<B><U><P>INTERVIEW WITH POLICEMEN</P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
</U><P>Q 25.00&#9;</B>&#9;Could you start by saying who you are?</P>
<B><P>A 25.04 </B>&#9;&#9;I’m PC 1028 Rob Wells and this is my colleague</P>
<B><P>A 25.12&#9;</B>&#9;PC 1041 Steve Coulter(?)</P>

<B><P>Q 25.18&#9;&#9;</B>What is your position in the police force?</P>




<B><P>A 25.26 -R&#9;</B>We police South Cerney, Cerney Wick, Shorncote, Somerford Keynes, Pool Keynes, Ewen, Kemble and Siddington.</P>
<B>




<P>Q 25.45&#9;&#9;</B>When did you first start working in the South Cerney area?</P>
<B><P>A 25.48 – R&#9;</B>I started working here on Monday, 28 September 1992</P>
<B><P>A 25.52 – S&#9;</B>I started in January 1996</P>

<B><P>Q 25.58&#9;&#9;</B>What changes have you seen since you took over?</P>




<B><P>A 26.00 - R&#9;</B>I’ve probably had the most changes, because of the Water Mark, all these holiday homes which we were informed would have their own security, but when I was speaking to the chap who was organising the public offering in the village hall I said so if somebody gets broken into in one of their chalets, what happens does your security deal with it.  Oh no.  So as you can see it’s down to us.</P>
<B><P>A 26.34 –S&#9;</B>And since 1996 I haven’t really seen too much in the way of changes other than the fact that the area we cover is continually growing, more and more houses, holiday homes and it’s just the number of people we have to deal with is increasing continually.  I’ve not been here as long as Rob, so the changes that I’ve witnessed are mainly in the area that we cover, and the number of people that we are responsible for, which is increasing continually with increased number of houses, holiday homes and plans to expand on those particular areas. In Kingfisher Place there’s another 20 houses, so there’s 50 or so extra people in the village.  I’d say we’ve got the largest village in the country in South Cerney, which is what we are responsible for.  Our main problem area is I should imagine much the same as any other area which is drugs and drug related crime, not wanting to worry anybody, it’s not a huge problem, but there are increasing numbers of young people who are taking various forms of drugs, and to support those habits they commit crime, such as breaking into vehicles, house burglaries, petty thefts. [<B>R</B> – There has been an increase in shoplifting, and it’s all to do with money for drugs, or products to survive because they spend their money on drugs.  Those are the main areas.</P>
<B>
<P>Q29.27&#9;</B>Do you have problems with shoplifting in South Cerney itself?</P>
<B><P>A 29.29 –R&#9;</B>Yes we do, it’s been on the increase of late, but there again, the number of drug dependent people in the village has increased slightly as a result of new ones moving in from Cirencester.  They obviously want to spend their money on something other than food, so they go and pinch their food. [<B>S</B> – You tend to get one person in the village taking drugs, who then encourages others to join in his habit and it tends to snowball from there, and involve the<B> </B>younger members of the village, who experiment and get hooked as well, which then obviously increases the amount of crime that we have to deal with.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 30.24</B>&#9;Do you want to go on with the major policing problems in South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 30.27 –S&#9;</B>I think our main problem is time.  Since April of 98, our division was restructured which involved leaving us to police Cirencester as well as our own area, which does leave South Cerney short on occasions, which means we haven’t really as much time as we used to have to set aside for South Cerney problems.  [<B>R</B> – Well it’s not just problems, it’s things like school visits, scouts and stuff like that, they have to take second place to policing priorities as far as the Superintendent in Cirencester sees it.  Obviously we get dragged in occasionally to man the immediate response vehicle, due to sickness or whatever, people on courses.  There are a few on long term sick, which doesn’t help the situation, so we get dragged in.</P>
<B><P>&#9;[S </B>– Time is the main enemy, because the more we are not here the work backlogs, so there is more for us to do when we do come back.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 31.57&#9;</B>What about the young people in the village?</P>
<B><P>A 31.59 – S&#9;</B>I think generally we have got quite a reasonable relationship with the majority of the very young.  The teenagers the problem ones we know and they know us.  <B>[R</B> – I think with the very young that’s where the school visits help, because obviously they see you visiting their school and from there on in they always wave and say hello to you while your driving about or walking round the village.  Obviously as they get bigger and bigger there is less street cred to be had being seen talking to a policeman, but I still get late teenagers and even ones in their 20’s stopping to have a chat when they are on there own, it’s just when they are with their mates they don’t want to speak to you.  [<B>S</B> – This is the benefit of being the local bobby, they recognise you and, they know who you are, you know them and their families, so they are least civil, 90% of the time they are civil, and they don’t mind speaking to you because they know who you are, there are a few that don’t speak, but then they don’t speak to anybody.</P>




<B><P>&#9;&#9;</B>I think generally we’ve got a reasonable relationship with the young.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>




<B><P>Q 33.36&#9;</B>Do you have a lack of resources if you have problems with the youngsters.  You can’t clip them round the ear like you used to be able to in the olden days.</P>
<B><P>A 33.50 –R&#9;</B>As much as you’d like to.  I think that would probably solve a lot of problems if you were allowed to. It’s not just a problem with the youngsters; it’s the youngsters’ parents occasionally.  Over some years now there has bee this attitude.  Parents’ attitude has changed as to what the police should and shouldn’t do.  A lot of people see a lot of £ signs when it is mentioned that their child was struck by a policeman, and they’re more likely to be ante the police as a result because if their child gets a clip round the ear from the local bobby and goes running home, in the past he probably got another clip round the ear from his father or mother, but now they seek compensation and things like that, so I think that's a big problem. [S – and try and convince parents that their young angels have done anything wrong in the first place is always an uphill battle, they will always take the side of the child and no matter what you say, what evidence you put before them.  [<B>R</B> – Then 4 or 5 years later when they are addicted to something, the parents turn to us for assistance, and ask why we didn’t do anything.</P>
<B><P>&#9;</B>It’s a lovely place during the summer, sunshine, water.  <B>[S</B> – You are policing a very beautiful part of the country, although it can be busy at times; it makes the 8 hours pass a bit quicker.  At least you are policing in pleasant scenery, I have policed in worse places. [<B>R</B> - And generally I think it’s fair to say that we have got the support of the majority of the villagers, which is always helpful, without their support, we would be on a losing wicket.  [<B>S</B> – The vast majority of the village want us here and support what we do, they realise that things do change and that it is busy and perhaps they are not going to see us on general patrols as much as they used to, but at least it’s a familiar face. [R- I think it’s important keeping links with the Parish Councils for example.  Fosseway Housing own a lot of what used to be council property in the village, we have a good relationship with the housing officer in Cirencester.  We have regular meetings with her and that seems to be bringing forth fruit of late, with crime prevention and things like that, so it’s all useful stuff, the problem as I see it, is because we are taken away so often something has got to drop out as it were, and that tends to be things like school visits, cubs meetings, it’s very difficult, you can arrange a meeting for next week with a group and not be able to turn up because you have been put on to the immediate response vehicle in Cirencester, and that is something that we have to put up with I’m afraid.  [<B>S</B> – That’s something that we are battling against at the moment to try and spend more time here, hopefully we will be successful and be able to get back to the way we used to police.  <B>[R</B> – Again it’s down to money and the force hasn’t got the money, so it has to make the best use of the resources it’s got, and we are part of the resources, so if they are short in Cirencester, then we will be used.  The days of the village bobby are rapidly declining.  Well when you think previously there used to be a policeman, there’s still a house with Constabulary impressed on it at Kemble.  So you had a policeman policing Kemble, you had the one policeman at South Cerney, but most large villages had their own policeman, and now we’re down to the two of us who work generally opposite shifts covering half a dozen or more villages, and all I can see is that is going to increase, we will have more villages to cover and as I say it’s all down to money, it costs a lot of money to keep a policeman in a job.  Short of a sudden injection of cash I can’t see things getting any better in the short term. [<B>S</B> – There will always a policeman responsible for the area, but its whether he will actually be based in the village or based at a larger police station and have to travel out.  [<B>R</B> – And the problem with basing the policeman at a larger police station to cover villages is that the villages don’t get this identity, you don’t get recognition of the local bobby from the local people, because they don’t see you arrive for work, they don’t see you leave from work.  We may be back at the police station a dozen times a day for various reasons during our patrol and people see us come and go and people recognise us and they link us with the police station, whereas if you are working somewhere like Cirencester then that’s not the case.  [<B>S</B>– people like to see the car parked outside, then they know somebody is here and if you do leave it out there then you get a visit, even if it’s only to pass the time of day, I mean that is one of the good things, people will just come in and say hello, because they haven’t seen you for a while, and it is that recognition that’s somewhat rewarding.  [<B>R</B> - And it’s that recognition you are going to lose if you have somebody, who is not actually stationed within the village.</P>

<B><P>Q 40.12</B>&#9;The days of plodding on foot round the beat  </P>
<B><P>A 40.15 -R</B>&#9;The days of plodding on foot round the beat died years ago, it’s all down to manpower, as I said before when we had a bobby stationed at Kemble, his sole area of responsibility was Kemble and Ewen perhaps, and he had 8 hours of the day to plod round his patch.  Now we could be in Cerney Wick for example and there might be something going on at Kemble that needs immediate police attention, and if we were on foot, it might take us 6 hours to get there.  [<B>S</B> – We are responsible for 140 square miles of land and you can be called from one end to the other continually through the day, and walking, you just couldn’t do it.  [<B>R</B> – Because they have lost all these policemen, they are looking at different ways of policing, so we have got Neighbourhood Watch  for example.  There are several schemes in South Cerney and they are our eyes and ears when we are not about, or when we are about, but somewhere else.  We have got the Special Constabulary; we have a couple of special constables that operate from South Cerney fairly exclusively.  We have now got Rural Watch, which is all the farmers and large land owners, again a similar sort of system to Neighbourhood Watch, whereby if they see something suspicious, or if they see something that they think we ought to know, they will let us know and we can let the rest of the farming community know.  A similar sort of scheme to Neighbourhood Watch, where if we have a lot of trouble with these pedlars for Nottingham, the fish sellers from South Shields.  We like to know when they are about and luckily our Neighbourhood Watch people generally let us know, and we can let other Neighbourhood Watch co-ordinators know so they can be on their guard, because these people are not just round here selling dusters or selling fish.  <B>[S</B> – The Neighbourhood Watch scheme we have got here is very efficient and very effective, but again our battle with time, spending time with the co-ordinators seems to take a backseat compared to the prioritized work, and if the Neighbourhood Watch think that we are not interested then they tend to lose interest themselves, so you lose that bond, and you don’t tend to get the assistance you want.  [<B>R</B> – Even something simple like pub visits, they seem to have gone by the board because they are not a priority.  We haven’t done as many pub visits since the 1<SUP>st</SUP> April, purely because we haven’t got the time to do it now.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 43.35</B>&#9;You don’t live in the village, either of you?</P>
<B><P>A 43.38&#9;</B>No.  <B>[R</B>- The police house in the village was on a short term lease to the Gloucestershire Housing Association, it has since bee taken back over by the Police Authority, who I imagine are hoping to sell it, because they’re always looking at ways to save money and make money and one way of saving money is to sell a property, because of property maintenance costs, especially on a house the age of the Police house at South Cerney are quite high and if they can realise the market value of that house, then they are going to do that.  Generally nowadays policemen don’t live in police houses, although I do, but I’m in the minority, and as such they sold of a lot of police property.  There used to be a police house at Poulton, they started policing Poulton from Fairford.  It was a WPC at Poulton, and when she left, they sold that, so that’s the way things are going, we are going to lose these small stations as stations and it’s all going to be policed from a larger station.  The Superintendent of the Cotswold and Stroud division is given a bag of money and there you go, that’s got to last you 12 months do with it what you will.  If he can sell a few police properties to increase the money in the bag, then that’s what he’s going to do, and of course at the same time save on maintenance costs.</P>
