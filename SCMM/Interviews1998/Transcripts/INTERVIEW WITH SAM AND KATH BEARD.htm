<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 20.24 &#9;&#9;</B>Where were you born?</P>
<B><P>A 20.25&#9;</B>Shorncote, which is a couple of miles up the road.</P>

<B><P>Q 20.40&#9;&#9;</B>Did you go to school here</P>
<B><P>A 20.43&#9;&#9;</B>Yes</P>
<B>
<P>Q 20.44&#9;&#9;</B>At what school?</P>
<B><P>A 20.45&#9;&#9;</B>It’s now called Ann Edwards school, but then in was South Cerney C of E.</P>

<B><P>Q 20.56&#9;&#9;</B>What was the teaching like then?</P>




<B><P>A 20.57</B>&#9;It’s difficult to assess as a child, but I would have thought very good. There were one or two star pupils, as I expect most schools have, just a little bit older than me we produced a professor who started his education at the school, that was Chip Mate.  I think his name was probably Charles, but everyone knew him as Chip, the local butcher’s son.  </P>





<B><P>Q 21.33&#9;&#9;</B>What were the teachers like?</P>




<B><P>A 21.34&#9;</B>The headmaster for most of the time was Mr Peyman.  Now he was very good, he placed great emphasis on sport.  On education as well obviously. But he took things in a different light to what is taken by the education people now.  In the winter, bad weather, if he thought there was going to be a frost the following morning, he would get the boy. Whose job it was to help the school cleaner, moving the desk, and get him to throw two or three buckets of water down the playground to make a slide.  Totally unheard of today.  And if it snowed, and you were caught throwing snowballs in the playground, there was no question about it, you had the stick straight away, but at the same time he would take you later in the morning up to the meadows, which is now Meadow Way and he would divide the boys in the tops two classes into sides and say right have a snowball fight, and he would join in on one side.  A bit different to the education of today.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 22.52&#9;</B>Do you think he was strict and fair?</P>
<B><P>A 22.53&#9;</B>Oh very much so, he took no messing, but on the other hand he was very fair.  If you broke school rules, there was no question of why you broke school rules, you broke them and you shouldn’t have done and you knew, so therefore you took your punishment.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 23.14&#9;</B>Can you describe a typical school day?</P>
<B><P>A 23.16&#9;</B>We usually used to start about 9 o’clock and the first thing we would have was religious education until about 9.45, then the next ¾ of an hour was maths, then we would have playtime and after that well it could be English or any related subjects.  On a Monday afternoon it was always painting for the boys and I think the girls used to go for needlework lessons.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 24.00&#9;</B>What happened when you got to a certain age and leaving?</P>
<B><P>A 24.01&#9;</B>I did all my schooling here, I left when I was 14.  The school leaving age wasn’t raised to 15 until the year after I left school.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 24.19&#9;</B>Were you there during the war, can you remember any events happening?</P>
<B><P>A 24.22&#9;</B>We had three air raid<B> </B>shelters in the playground, one was against the school building, one was against the wall of school lane itself and one was against a cottage that has now been demolished.  They were huge concrete pipes that were made by Norcons in the village and they were round inside and you were supplied with little rush mats that you sat on.  They were worn out on the playground for PE.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 25.13&#9;</B>Did you do your physical education out in the playground?</P>
<B><P>A 25.14&#9;</B>We did exercises that were the vogue and the time, jumping up and turning round.  I think it was called PT then.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 25.33&#9;</B>What did you do when you left school?</P>
<B><P>A 25.34&#9;</B>I went to work for Mr Berkeley as an apprentice carpenter and joiner.  I stayed there after Mr Berkeley retired, I stayed they working with his son Brian.  When he retired I just went on working there.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 25.56&#9;</B>Your family owns the yard?</P>
<B><P>A 25.57&#9;</B>Yes it’s now my sons’.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 26.06&#9;</B>When did the big developments start in the village, you know, the first estates?</P>
<B><P>A 26.10&#9;</B>It was about 1964 when things first started to move, when Berkeley Close was built and Meadow Way and that all followed closely on the heels of sewerage being installed in the village.  Nothing happened much before then, but then it took off and has been going ever since.</P>
<B>
<P>Q26.43&#9;</B>Do you think the village has reached saturation point as far as houses?</P>
<B><P>A 26.50&#9;</B>As a village, I think it’s past it, but I’m sure it will go on growing.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 26.57&#9;</B>Has it been a good place to bring up children?</P>
<B><P>A 26.59&#9;</B>It used to be because they weren’t restricted as much as I assume children in urban areas would be, because you could go and play in fields. We certainly did, but that is becoming less possible.  As small boys we used to play in the gravel pits a lot.  Now called lakes but as far as we were concerned pits.</P>
<B>




<P>Q 27.35&#9;</B>&#9;Do you remember anything being dug up in the prehistoric line?</P>




<B><P>A 27.36&#9;</B>Yes, the stone coffin which is at the side of All Hallows Church, I think that was dug up in 1942.  It was in the pit which is now owned by the Angling Club opposite the Redlands Tile factory.  With it were two lead coffins as well, one was knocked to pieces by the earth excavator, which discovered them, the large stone of the stone coffin was split in two, and that’s what split it, the excavator hitting it.  I understood the other coffin went down to Bristol, in the middle of war things like that didn’t matter too much.  </P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 28.40</B>&#9;What sports did you play?</P>
<B><P>A  28.44&#9;</B>Well if you go back far enough, they used to play something called quoits, but I don’t know what that actually consisted of.  In my life it’s been football, cricket , bowls, tennis.  The football club has been gong for very many years, and I understand from villagers that are no longer with us that there were several teams that all joined together and became South Cerney United, and I’ve even seen of a photograph to that extent.  But United has now been dropped for many years.  It’s a sport that a lot of people took part in and it was of great interest for the locals, particularly up to just after the war, when there wasn’t any television or cars to make things easy, the local football team would gather a crowd of 100 quite easily, probably more for special matches.  Then there was the cricket team, which was never quite as successful as the football team; well, we’ve still got a cricket team but there have been periods of time when that has gone out of existence and been resurrected.  The tennis club’s the same; they used to have teams prior to the war. They’ve got one going again now, but there was a long lay off and the same with the bowls club.  I didn’t play bowls or tennis, but I played football and cricket.  Then of course you get your pubs games, I’m not sure if you would call darts and skittles sport.  They used to have athletics races at the Flower Show and that was quite a big thing, they would have cycling and athletics.  Fred Gough was a well-known local cyclist, he was quite well known for his prowess on the bicycle, and there were one or two well-known runners, Wilfred Blinco, but they performed before my time so I’m only talking about hearsay.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 31.38&#9;</B>How long has your family been in this village?</P>
<B><P>A 31.40&#9;</B>Since 1934.  That’s when mum and dad came to the village with my two brothers and my sister.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 31.56&#9;</B>Where did they come from?</P>
<B><P>A 31.58&#9;</B>Well we lived at Shorncote for a few years, I’m not sure how long, but prior to that we lived at the Dillies and then another of the farms up the Stow Road.  Mother’s side was Cirencester, and my father was born in Tetbury, but they moved around a bit, father’s family did.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 32.25&#9;</B>Was he a builder too?</P>
<B><P>A 32.29</B>&#9;No they were farmers, well on my mother’s side they ran a laundry at Gloucester Street, on my father’s side, his father was a sort of a farmer but he developed into a farmer from a contract agricultural worker, to keeping public house and to running a haulage business with horses and carts.  Then we eventually moved here, our branch of the family.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 33.06</B>&#9;Is there anything you would like for the future for South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 33.10&#9;</B>What I’d like is people to get themselves sorted out sports club wise.  You feel that the Parish Council could do more, but it’s easy to criticise and not to easy to do, so I would like to get the community life more organised, but it is very difficult.  If one makes these statements you should be prepared to jump out, but I don’t know if I am.  </P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 33.44&#9;</B>Do you think the size of the village is a problem?</P>
<B><P>A 33.46&#9;</B>It could be because it’s a large village but it’s not a town is it?  I know there was a move afoot to get it called a town, but whatever you call it doesn’t alter the physical facts, so it’s difficult.  We get lots of newcomers coming with all sorts of good ideas, some of them are very good, but some of them start to change what we’ve got and then they disappear and left with not always the best in the world, but life’s like that isn’t it?</P>
<B>
<P>Q 34.27</B>&#9;How many sons have you got?</P>
<B><P>A 34.29&#9;</B>Two</P>
<B>
<P>Q 34.32&#9;</B>And they are carrying on the business?</P>
<B><P>A 34.33&#9;</B>Yes they are carrying on the business, well they started with me, we all three were involved in the starting of it, now I’m retired and they’re carrying on.</P>
<P>On VE Day we gathered together lots of rubbish and wood from the trees</P>
<P>fallen down in the gravel pits, which is now Jubilee Gardens, and we built this dummy, which I think was supposed to represent Hitler, which we burnt and made a good bonfire which lasted two or three hours.  There was a party held in the Leaze, because part of the Leaze hadn’t been built on prior to the war.  There was a small area there where tables were erected, and goodness knows where the food came from but they produced some.  I don’t really remember anything happening for VJ Day, but I’m sure something must have done.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P>Q 35.46&#9;</B>What about the Camp during the war?</P>
<B><P>A 35.48</B>&#9;The Camp was a flying training school; my father actually worked on the Camp.  His official title was groundsman, which I think involved cutting the grass in the grass growing season and do whatever else a tractor was required for in other seasons, but I know during the summer he worked extremely long hours, because it was his job to keep the grass cut and it was a big field when you had one of those small old fashioned mowers, and he used to go in early in the morning to be there when the night training flying ceased and he would mow for two or three hours before the day training started, because when they were flying for training he couldn’t cut the grass, and he used to go early in the mornings, work until about 9.30, then come home and then go back and do the same at 7.30, before they changed from daytime flying to nighttime flying.  He was quite happy to do that, he thought he was doing his bit.  The Camp was started in 1937 I think, but of course they were flying and they had some very noisy Harvards I remember.  We complain about Concorde and some of the American kit, but I remember those Harvards were just as noisy when they came low over the village.  The Camp was much bigger than it is now, it incorporated several of the fields on both sides of the 419 and Armour Lane, which used to be called Northmoor Lane.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 37.34&#9;</B>Do you remember as a boy riding round on a bicycle and seeing the Home Guard?</P>
<B><P>A 37.46</B>&#9;I didn’t see so much of the Home Guard, although there was quite a strong battalion here.  What I remember most is the accidents with the aeroplanes.  Down Bow Wow by the canal bridge, which has now gone, there was an Airspeed Oxford crashed into the hedge there.  I don’t know what happened to the crew or who was flying it, but one landed there.  Down opposite Cotswold Hoburne, a Spitfire crashed there.  I can’t tell you what happened to the crews, because they just don’t know.  One afternoon in the middle of the summer 1943 or 44 two Oxfords collided up over Tudmore and I know one of the engines fell into the Tudmore Gardens, and being small boys when that happened you get on your bike and you go or if you think it’s closer you run don’t you.  I think only one chap got out of those planes.  Just after Dunkirk I think there was a Middlesex Regiment stationed in the village. I don’t know if it was a full battalion, but some were stationed here and when the army was training for Normandy, the Polish Airborne was in the village for about three days on some kind of œ a lot of them spent time in what in now Ham Farm, where Richard Bradley lives down Station Road.  On another occasion I think we had what must have been the RSC because we had lots of lorries in the meadows and they stayed there for a few days as part of some Army manœuvres.  The crossroads down at Latton were full of airborne troops all in tents.</P>
<B><P>&#9;</B>Going back to during the war; gardening, because dig for victory was one of the great themes, and our headmaster Mr Peyman encouraged us, made us, guided us, and we did the school gardens, which were behind the school in School Lane.  We then had two allotments in Jubilee Gardens, that was all allotments in those days and we also used to dig a piece of rough ground behind Bradley’s washing plant, which was right in the middle of the village, and we used to grow all sort of things, potatoes.  I remember one allotment that was almost full of parsnips.  We planted three seeds to a hole four inches apart, and it’s amazing how many seeds you get to an ounce.  We used to have currant bushes and strawberries, gooseberries and the other sort of more general plants.  We used to have a lecturer come out and tell us how we should do things and grow things and the school used to sell the produce to one another and I knew the first lot of money went towards buying a wireless set, which was installed in Mr Peyman’s top class, and I can remember one afternoon when Moscow’s Dynamos came over to play various teams, us having it on and listening to it while we were in lesson, but I think Mr Penman was as interested in listening to it as we were.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 42.27&#9;</B>He sounds very human</P>
<B><P>A 42.29</B>&#9;Oh he was</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 42.32&#9;</B>Can you tell me if there was a master’s and a mistress’s cottage, because they were built in the 19<SUP>th</SUP> Century by Ann Edwards herself, and they are described as being behind the school, now where were they?</P>
<B><P>A 42.50&#9;</B>If you stand in School Lane looking at the main body of the building, the house was built directly behind it, tight against what is now our builders’ yard boundary wall, and it was quite a long building and I remember it being knocked down. But I can’t put a date to it.  Mr Rigall, he was the first headmaster I remember being there, he lived in there with his wife</P>
<P>and son and daughter, but when he left, Mr Peyman never did.  It was let to a family by the name of Kent, but the school did retain one room which was used as the headmaster’s office and at times it was also used by the visiting medical officer who used to check if we were fit and healthy, and likewise the dentist who would come and see what sort of condition your teeth were in.  I didn’t mind the doctor coming, but the dentist would bring an air of absolute fear and horror to the rest of the school for the whole week he would be there carrying out the extractions and the fillings that the children needed.  You used to go and sit in class, the monitor would come in and ask the teacher for a certain name, you didn’t know if it was yours, you didn’t know what time you would be going, so all day long you would be sitting thinking, when am I going to sit in the dentist’s chair and what is he going to do?  </P>

</FONT><B><P>Q 44.51&#9;</B>How many classrooms were there in the school?</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>A 44.55&#9;</B>Five</P>
<B>
<P>Q 45.00&#9;</B>Actual rooms?</P>
<B><P>A 45.02</B>&#9;Yes, divided off properly.  Sorry 4, but there was one class held in the village hall.  The need for that arose when we had the evacuees from London.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 45.18&#9;</B>Tell me about the evacuees, did you make friends with them?</P>
<B><P>A 45.20&#9;</B>Yes, I can’t really remember too much about the evacuees for some reason, but we had quite a few in the village.  There was one who came, his name was Harry Parker, he came with his sister, and they were evacuated to the then reverend Kennon(?) who was the vicar of the village at the time, all through the war, and he now lives in Cirencester, he never went back to London.  There were quite a few. </P>
<B>
<P>Q 46.02&#9;</B>Were the Dorlings from London?</P>
<B><P>A 46.10</B>&#9;I’m not sure where the Dorlings came from originally, but prior to coming to South Cerney they had been in Rhodesia hadn’t they?  Or South Africa, somewhere that way, but I don’t know where exactly.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 46.41&#9;</B>Who designed the table here?</P>
<B><P>A 46.44&#9;</B>Well I suppose you would say I designed it, if that’s the right word.  It was a style of table I always had in mind of making and that’s it.  I made it 15 or 16 years ago.  The base of the table is all old timber made from some timbers taken out of my shed roof and some was taken out of the door frame that used to be the entrance door to the back yard.  The top is all new, it all English oak, and I personally like it, I don’t know if other people do.  </P>

<B><P>Q 47.29&#9;</B>Why did you make it?</P>
<B><P>A 47.30&#9;</B>I’d always fancied having a table like that to be honest. </P>
<B>

</B></U><FONT SIZE=2>
<B><P>Q 47.49&#9;</B>Where were you born?</P>
<B><P>A 47.50</B>&#9;I was born in the village in Broadway Lane, number 13.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 48.00</B>&#9;Where did you go to school?</P>
<B><P>A 48.01&#9;</B>I went to the School in the old school in School Lane, from the age of 5.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 48.12&#9;</B>When you were small what were the classes consisting of?</P>
</FONT><B><P>A 48.16</B>&#9;<FONT SIZE=2>We had four classes and Mr Peyman was my headmaster, and the infant  teacher<B>&#9;</B>when we first went was a Miss Breetsford(?) who was very, very strict.  I would consider nowadays that she would be too strict for little ones. About 4 years ago, I was round the village and this lady stopped to chat, and she said I know you, and I said do you, she said yes I was your teacher when you first started school.  She was visiting and of course she was married.  We had Miss Dunn who came from Ewen, she used to cycle in her early days and we had, when the evacuees came, Mrs Chapman and a Mrs Mitchell came with them and we also had a Miss Jones, but as far as I can remember they were happy days.  I always remember Mrs Timbrell, when I went to school in Cirencester when I was older, she gave me an Oxford English dictionary with a nice message written in the front, and I’ve still got that book even now.  She was strict, but she was good and she lived in Station Road, and during the war she had two evacuees staying with her, a brother and a sister.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 50.11&#9;</B>Do you think what they taught you at school was a good beginning?</P>
<B><P>A 50.13</B>&#9;Yes I do.  We used to have religious education every day and that was right from tinies.  And arithmetic of course, and in those days the times table was taught in a singing fashion and I think it is so sad these days that children don’t learn their times table like we did.  Miss Dunn was very strict on writing, your letters must touch the top line, and she was very particular about her teaching methods.  Several years ago, about 5 or 6 years ago she died, but up until then she always sent us a Christmas card, and in all that time her writing never changed, and it was lovely.  Of course we had inkwells and pens, and as you know, the boys used to flick it and we had the old desks with the inkwells in.  But you were expected to write with a pen and ink, no blots.  We used to go to the meadows, what is now Meadow Way, River Way, that was our sports ground and we had lots of fun out there.  And the teachers used to join us, which was good.</P>

<B><P>Q 51.49&#9;</B>Do you remember when the old school changed?</P>
<B><P>A 51.51</B>&#9;I can’t really remember when it changed, I remember them building the new school down there, but I think it must have been a very sad time because there were lots of memories left behind there.  Perhaps the old school was an old place but I’ve got lots of happy memories, some sad, but on the whole we were quite happy there and you had your friends there.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 52.27&#9;</B>Have you got any wartime memories of the village?</P>
<B><P>A 53.30&#9;</B>Well I remember when the siren used to sound, it was on a steam crane in Bradley’s yard, which is now Camas, and one day when it went I was down Station Road, because we lived in Broadway Lane and there was Silver Street, High Street and Station Road and all the children used to gather together from different streets and we were down Station Road one day, and I expect you remember Cyril Stephens, he was my cousin, and when the siren went on his particular day, I wasn’t very old, because when war started I was only 5 and having two older brothers, I used to tag on to my brothers, and he came to pick me up on a bicycle down there and I always remember him bringing  me home saying coming on your mum’s looking for you, you’ve got to come home and he gave me a crossbar right through the village, unheard these days, but times during the war.  When we were growing up, we all had to do our little bit and my father went into the RASC, and he was posted abroad, so of course lots of things fell to mum to do.  I had two brothers, John and Peter and one sister Helen, who was younger, she was born during the war and really my mother had to do quite a lot.  Of course it was open fires then and she had to chop all the wood because my brothers weren’t quite old enough to do it, and I remember she cut both thumbs with an axe.  There were lots of fathers that went off so the children stuck together and in our road we had an awful lot of children and we had evacuees, but I remember every bonfire night after the war every street had a bonfire and it was great excitement, and another thing we had to do, we were expected to collect waste paper, and that was stored in what is, well I think it’s a generator next to the United church next to the George pub and the row of cottages there.  But as children we were expected to go and do it, and we also had to go and pick rose hips for Delrosa syrup, and you would see children coming in with mums and dads would go out pick them and they would have sacks of rose hips round there.  Whatever we did when we were at school Mr Peyman always encouraged us and we’ve got so much to be grateful to him for, he was a super headmaster and right up until he died he always acknowledged us, he was a very kind man, you could always rely on his he was an absolutely super man, and we’ve got a lot to be thankful for.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 56.05&#9;</B>I forgot to ask you what your maiden name was?</P>
<B><P>A 56.11&#9;</B>My maiden name was Stephens, and my father was Denis Stephens born in Cerney Wick, one of 13 children.  My mother was a Gillman from Cirencester, and she was an only child and when she met my father and they wee married her mother-in-law took her into the family as another child and accepted her.  He worked on the farm quite a lot, he worked for Mr. Hapgood, and towards the end of his working life he worked at Mr Berkeley’s along with Sam.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 57.14&#9;</B>Is that how you met?</P>
<B><P>A 57.15&#9;</B>Sam lived at 7 Broadway Lane, and I lived at 13, and having 2 older brothers, of course, he used to come and play because those were the days where everybody was in and out of each other’s houses.  Then he went away and did his National Service and didn’t think anything of him.  It was just a friend growing up with my brothers, and boys all round and when he came back from National Service I was out walking one day and we just stopped and talked and he said would you like to go for a walk, so I went for a walk and it went from there.  We were married in All Hallows Church on 26 November 1955.  We lived at 4 Station road from 1955 to 1963, and we moved here in 1963, and we shall have been here 35 years this year.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 58.25</B>&#9;You’ve got a particularly nice table here, how did it come to be here?</P>
<B><P>Q 58.31&#9;</B>We had when we moved here quite a lot of work to do, and we had two very large sheds and one previously, years ago, had been used by Ben Smith the gardener at what is now Atkyns Manor, and he used to cut hair out there.  Anyway Sam decided that he would like to make the two sheds into one, so we had somewhere to put the cars in, having had children that wanted cars, so he demolished the middle wall, and with the timber that he got out he designed and made this table, and he did it in time for our silver wedding anniversary, and it’s lovely when we have the family here because we all sit round it and have a gossip and lots of cups of tea have been had round it and lots of happy times, so I’ve got lots of happy memories of it.  So he did it for me.  He made it for our silver wedding anniversary in 1980.  </P>
<B>
<P> </P>
<P>Q 00.04&#9;</B>How have your children grown up here, have they been happy?</P>
<B><P>A 00.09</B>&#9;Yes, I think they have, they have attended Ann Edwards School and gone on to Deer Park School and of course since they were small things have changed, because when we first came here these were still green fields at the back of us in Meadow Way and Helen Dorling used to exercise her horses on a little paddock at the back, so of course the boys used to sit on the wall and watch.  I think they have been very happy here, because we have tried to involve ourselves in things that they do, and always tried to give them time when they were little, we used to go for nice walks and play different games with them.  </P>

<P>Q 01.02&#9;</B>Any grandchildren?</P>
<B><P>A 01.04&#9;</B>Yes we have 6 grandchildren, 3 boys and 3 girls, the eldest is 21, the second is 19, we have two 18-year-olds, a 9-year-old and a 7.</P>

</FONT><P>Q&#9;</B>Was there anything down at the College that you remember about?</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>A&#9;</B>When we were about 11 or 12, Miss Hall, who used to live at the College, used to run a sewing class, I think it was on a Tuesday evening, and one of the things I remember most, was we had to sit in a back room that was very dark, lit with oil lamps, but there was always this overpowering smell of oil lamps.  She was very kind.  Of course at that time it was mostly occupied by clergy widows or their daughters and I remember most of the elderly ladies that lived there, Miss Mitcheson, Mrs Eardley, Miss Hall, and later of course Mrs Waddington-Jones and Mrs Lister.   When we were small there were very refined ladies there and I’ve always considered it a lovely building, but very cold.  As you can imagine in those days, it wasn’t the warmest of places to go to sew.</P>
<B>
<P>Q&#9;</B>What did she teach?</P>
<B><P>A&#9;</B>No really large articles, just bookmarks or tray cloths and things like that, but she was very good and taught us all sorts of different things, we would always start with a prayer.</P>
<B>




<P>Q&#9;&#9;</B>Do you have any of her paintings?</P>




<B><P>A</B>&#9;Yes, one behind you and one on the stairs.  She had an exhibition once, and I bought one, but I understand, it was before we were married, but with Miss Hall’s paintings, when a village girl was getting married, she would always give them a painting of their house, which was a lovely present, because as you know her paintings were lovely.</P>





<B><P>Q</B>&#9;&#9;Do you belong to any of the women’s clubs in the village?</P>




<B><P>A&#9;</B>I belong to the Women’s Institute and we meet once a month, and I belong to the gardening club and we belong to the Trust and quite involved with church as well.</P>
<B>
<P>Q</B>&#9;What do you think is the benefit of being in the Women’s Institute?</P>
<B><P>A</B>&#9;We’re not a terrifically big group now, it seems to be that social activities and that are changing very much nowadays, but I’ve made some very good friends and we have had some good times there, and I suppose it’s just meeting people with different outlooks on life, different speakers and it’s very interesting.</P>

<B><P>Q</B>&#9;You never knew Miss Haddow?</P>
<B><P>A&#9;</B>Miss Grace Haddow, no I didn’t.</P>
<B>
<P>Q&#9;</B>Do you remember the old flower shows?</P>
<B><P>A&#9;</B>They were held where the present playing field is now and they used to have a huge marquee up there, and on the sports side of it, they used to have athletics and gymkhanas, but the flower show, they used to have the most beautiful<B> </P>

</B><LI>prizes, and the exhibitions of fruit and vegetables were to be admired and my father who was a competent gardener used to put his things in, and for days before he was scrubbing all the vegetables and getting things them to the same length or the same size.  On the day of the flower show we used to have a lovely carnival procession, which would start in the Berries, which is a field in front of the College and it would come through, with the most lovely floats, and that went on for many years, because I remember our two boys were in it one year, so it was up until quite recent years, but they used to have the most lovely displays of flowers, and as you went into the tent it had a smell all of its own, but the flower show was a day really to be awaited, and all the prizes used to be, Mr. Johnson in the High Street used to have an electrical business, and in his shop window he would display all the great big cups that would be competed for and they were really lovely. I’m sad to see it go, but times change.</LI></OL>
