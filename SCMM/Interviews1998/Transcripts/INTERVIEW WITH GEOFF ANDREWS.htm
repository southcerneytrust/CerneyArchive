<P>Q 27.05&#9;&#9;</B>Tell me your name</P>
<B><P>A 27.07&#9;&#9;</B>Geoffrey Andrews</P>

<B><P>Q 27.09&#9;&#9;</B>Were you born in South Cerney?</P>




<B><P>A 27.10&#9;</B>No in Siddington, so not far away, about 2 miles away.  Came here in my late teens early 20’s. </P>
<B>
</FONT><P>Q 27.19&#9;</B>What did you come to do here?</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>A 27.22&#9;</B>Well my parents shifted to a house here, the house we lived in wasn’t terribly big and we moved here because of the size of the house more than anything and I was working on a farm then at Ewen, working on a goat farm, which I stayed on for about then years.  I left that and got married and took a pub, took the Old George in South Cerney here.  We stayed there for 7 years and had a few alterations done, it’s quite a bit different to what it was then of course, and different clientele in there, it was very much a local pub, cider house more that a beer house.  It was a really interesting passage of time.  My family was born there, 2 daughters.  During my time at the pub I took up a spare time job grave digging, that was a want in the village.  Art Painter, the old blacksmith in the village had done it previously but he showed me all the ropes, taught me all there was to know about it, he had done it for quite a few years and he was ready to give up and they were looking for someone and I had a bit of spare time and it was a good way of getting some fresh air in your lungs, because, always being used to being outside, the pub was a bit smoky.  They didn’t have extractor fans in pubs like they have now, so I was quite pleased to get some fresh air, a thrash as they say, having a little bit of work to do.  Then we left the pub and I started doing bits of building, which I was always quite interested in and in between the grave digging, and went about various parts of the country, local country building with a gang of builders and in between times, I built the house we are in now and the one my daughter is in round the village in South Cerney, I built one in Fairford and another one in the village, I built about 4 houses in between times and then I suppose I almost got to where I am now, on the decline, I am not doing very much now just doing bits of odd jobs and a few graves and a bit of  bearing at the funerals.  Funerals are sorrowful occasions on some occasions, quite joyful on others, because when people have had a good life and especially if they’re church people, they rejoice, which is quite nice and that makes it quite a bit better.  And that’s about the end of the story.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 30.28&#9;</B>How long have you actually been?</P>
<B><P>A 30.34&#9;</B>I started when I was 29, and I’m 69 now so that’s 40 years isn’t it? When I first went to the pub, when I first got married when I was 29.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 30.51</B>&#9;Did you get on with the brewers at all?</P>
<B><P>A 30.54</B>&#9;Yes, remarkably well, they were different in those days to what they are now in as much as that you were working for a brewer then, whose only interest in pubs was to sell beer, that’s what they were, nowadays they’re estate agents.  The rent for the property was very little, was not of very much consequence, but neither were the profits, the profits were relatively small, but it worked out OK that way, but now the rents are enormous and the rates or course, and the profits have to be that much higher, that is why alcohol is so expensive these days for that reason.  Yes it the Stroud Brewery I worked for, but it was an Ushers house and they transferred that during the war.  The Ushers people from Trowbridge swapped some houses with the Stroud Brewery at Stroud to make transport easier and that was one of the houses that was swapped from an Ushers House to a Stroud house.  Previous to that I think it used to belong to a man named Price in Cirencester, and I think he used to brew his own beer, as lots of houses did in those days didn’t they at one stage, they brewed their own beer, Nowadays all beer is more or less the same more or less, it tastes a little bit different, but they try to get it all the same quality.  When they brewed their own beer, each brew was different and I suppose people got used to that and liked it.  But nowadays if someone asked for a pint of Flowers, he would expect to have a certain taste and a certain standard, but then that was not the case, and I think that was probably more interesting, the glorious uncertainty of it, as long as it was nice they enjoyed it.</P>

<B><P>Q 32.51</B>&#9;Did you have any regular characters amongst your?</P>
<B><P>A 32.55</B>&#9;Yes I suppose we did, probably more then than there are now, because they were more local, and they made their own enjoyment in as much as what other people were doing they seemed slightly eccentric.  I don’t think there are as many eccentric people about now as there used to be. There are some odd people about but they are not the harmless eccentrics like they used to be, which was quite interesting.  Some of them were not always easy to deal with with their eccentricities I must say.</P>

<B><P>Q33.38</B>&#9;Anybody in particular?</P>
<B><P>A 33.40</B>&#9;Yes there were one or two, but their relations are still about in the village, so I’m not prepared to mention their names because I’m sure you would go on and I would be asked the sort of things they did and some would not stand the light of day, they weren’t really bad, but they were a bit on the borderline.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 34.06</B>&#9;How many children have you got?</P>
<B><P>A 34.10</B>&#9;I’ve got two daughters, they were both born when I was in the pub, and that was really one of the reasons why we got out, when they got a little bit older, a pub is not a good place to bring up a family, or I don’t think so because when they get so they want to a bit of looking after, that’s just the time you are busy and in the evenings and things so it’s not really a good place to bring up young families.</P>

<B><P>Q 34.30</B>&#9;Did they go to Ann Edwards School?</P>
<B><P>A 34.33</B>&#9;Yes they did, and on into Cirencester after.  Quite happy there, enjoyed it.</P>

<B><P>Q 34.48</B>&#9;On the grave side, has it increased, is it a retiring population?</P>
<B><P>A 34.57</B>&#9;South Cerney is quite a big village, there’s a fairly aged population, quite a lot of them are newcomers.  A lot more people are being cremated than they were, so I should think round about the same amount of burials happen in the churchyard as there always has.  There are obviously more people dying, because there are more people here, but quite a lot are being cremated.  Somebody told me the other day, he’d gone to some big town and said they don’t even allow burials, it’s all cremations because of the shortage of ground of course, and we’ve found that ourselves and are looking round for a bit more.</P>

<B><P>Q 35.41</B>&#9;Do you have to maintain the graveyard?</P>
<B><P>A 35.44</B>&#9;No that used to be done by voluntary labour and then the Council took it over, we pay for it on the rates I suppose.  We pay for it eventually, which seems right and they had difficulty getting the volunteers, so maybe that’s just as well that someone does it regularly and it’s done quite well, quite successfully.</P>

<B><P>Q 36.12</B>&#9;Did you ever find anything interesting?</P>
<B><P>A 36.16</B>&#9;No I didn’t really.  I think that’s a question a lot of people ask you, but I haven't found anything interesting.  Not from looking, I keep looking and hoping.  I found what appears to be a brass plate, and I put a fork though that so that wasn’t very much, but that was all I never found anything, coins or rings or valuable things, or anything interesting that is not valuable.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 36.55</B>&#9;I noticed a trough, just on the left-hand side of your door coming in, has that come from the graveyard?</P>
<B><P>A 37.00</B>&#9;No, that came from, I built a bungalow in South Cerney by the cross and that was from the person’s garden along with some of the stones that are outside the front of the house, those stones that came out of the local tile quarries.  They were the big tiles on the bottom of the house, but those were even bigger and I suppose at the time that they dug those out, they were the nearest thing to prefabrication.  Quite often people made pigsties out of them and that’s where they came from, they were pigsties, they were put up quick, and quite substantial and now of course they are quite valuable, quite a nice thing to have.</P>

<B><P>Q 37.55</B>&#9;Inaudible question</P>
<B><P>A 38.00</B>&#9;Yes Mr Stark, he was quite a character.  I didn’t know him as well as some people, because he was a lot of things to a lot of people.  He came here in the RAF and he was Leonard Cheshire’s  batman, and they both got on remarkably well, and because of that he had carte blanche in the Camp up here while he was in the RAF, and when he got demobbed from the RAF, he did odd jobs around there and sort of lived up there wherever he could get his head down, but he did good things, but he used to go round people’s dustbins to do things, and bring bits that he found in dustbins apart from anything else all the local pensioners and various other people and the local organisations, he put a cup up for the Flower Show, the Herbert Stark cup, and all sorts of things like that.  He used to have an old butcher’s carrier bike, he used to carry bits and pieces around on the carrier bike, and occasionally he brought food down, you were never quite sure where the food came from so most people didn’t used to eat that they got rid of that, but he had a funeral in the Parish Church when he died and the Parish Church was full, which is quite something.  And an old man said to me there is only one man missing from this funeral and that was Mr Stark, because in life he liked the occasion, he was always at most people’s funeral and liked to be represented, and he liked see his name in the paper that he’d represented such and such.  So that was quite a nice send off for him, but in between times he did quite a lot of good, and everybody knew him, but he did some very odd things as well.</P>

<B><P>Q 40.55</B>&#9;Do you remember the family at Crane Farm at all, Griffiths?</P>
<B><P>A 41.00</B>&#9;Not as well as some people no, I knew Tom Griffiths, but I wasn’t about when Tom’s father had a mule.  I’ve heard the old people talk about Tom Griffiths’ mule, and when he used to go round with the coal, but I didn’t know them ever so well, I knew Tom to speak to, he was a character again, he did and said quite interesting things.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 41.30</B>&#9;What about any of the clergy ladies at The College?</P>
<B><P>A 41.33</B>&#9;No I didn’t know many of those.  I suppose the local children knew about them because they were associated with them when they went to choir and singing and went to church.  But coming in my late teens early 20’s that phase of knowing the people of the village had gone for me, which was a bit sad and likewise as in most villages, the families are getting a little bit mixed up and I had some difficulty in sorting all that out, again, if you go to school in the village and you associate with all the people who are associated with the family, you get to know who our so and so is, or whether it’s an aunt or whatever it is, but I never knew that, so I had to be more careful than a lot of people about what I said.  Well hopefully you wouldn’t say anything bad about them, but you had to be a little bit careful.</P>

<B><P>Q 42.30</B>&#9;Did you do any war service?</P>
<B><P>A 42.32</B>&#9;No I didn’t.  I was born in 1929, so I was ten when the war started, and it was over when I was old enough, so I didn’t.  </P>

<B><P>Q 42.53</B>&#9;The amenities that there are in South Cerney.</P>
<B><P>A  42.56</B>&#9;There are some good amenities in the village.  I’ve just been to Bill Fletcher’s wedding and we were just talking there about the amenities.  A man was saying that his son’s getting married and going to live in another village and they’ve got no shops, no post office and how fortunate we are to have the amenities in the village, we’ve got a good shop, we used to have two shops and now we’ve got one, but that’s quite big.  Unfortunately the butcher’s just left and that’s a bit sad, he said he couldn’t make it pay and we’ve got an off licence and a fish and chip shop and a take away and a little delicatessen which is very nice, so I think we’re very lucky, what else? The little pharmacy, which is quite handy to save people going into Cirencester for their pills and potions.  Yes I think we’ve very fortunate.  I don’t visit them very much because my daughter does that; I’m not really into shopping.  Ladies I think like having money given to them to go shopping, I think it’s something to do with their psyche, but I don’t really enjoy shopping.</P>

<B><P>Q 44.21</B>&#9;Do you belong to any particular clubs in the village?</P>
<B><P>A 44.25</B>&#9;No I don’t, I go to the Music and Gramophone Club in Cirencester once a fortnight, they used to have the Royal and Ancient Order of the Buffs in the village, but that went.  They used to have a men’s supper club, which I used to belong to, but I don’t think that’s functioning anymore, so no I don’t.  I don’t really know what there is nowadays I must admit, for men if anything, other than the local watering hole.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 45.04</B>&#9;And also I suppose your garden?</P>
<B><P>A 45.06</B>&#9;Yes, I do a bit of gardening, I’m not a great gardener, but I do a bit or gardening a few bits and pieces.  I’ve got some onions out there drying.  Soon be potato digging time, there used to be some grass out there, but I got fed up with mowing it so I dug it up and used it for vegetables, and it’s much less work.</P>
