</B></U><FONT SIZE=2><P>Tape 8</P>





<B><P>Q (28.47)&#9;</B>Where were you born?</P>
<B><P>A (28.48)&#9;</B>Looe in Cornwall</P>
</FONT>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>Q (28.53)</B>&#9;You spent all your early childhood there?</P>
<B><P>A (28.54)&#9;</B>Yes I lived in Looe until I was 18, then when I went to college I didn’t really go back again afterwards, so I went home in the holidays when I was a student, but I haven’t really lived there since.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (29.07)&#9;</B>You taught?</P>
<B><P>A (20.12)&#9;</B>Yes I taught in London first of all, then Swindon then in<B> </B>Cirencester and finally Gloucester.  So I’ve moved around a little bit but not a lot.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (29.24)&#9;</B>When did you first come to South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A (29.25)&#9;</B>We came to South Cerney to live in 1977.  I first came to South Cerney, I think, in 1959 when I was a schoolboy in the Air Training Corps and I went for a fortnights camp at RAF South Cerney as it was known in those days and I didn’t see anything of South Cerney at all, because we stayed on the camp and I thought that was South Cerney. So I had a little surprise when we came to live here.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (29.57)&#9;</B>Where did you teach later?</P>
<B><P>A (29.58)&#9;</B>I taught at Kingshill School for 11 years, I was one of the founder staff.  The school started in 1976 and I went there as Head of Science in 1976 and left as Deputy head in 1987.  Then I went to Gloucester after that.<B>&#9;</P>

<P>Q (30.15)</B>&#9;As a teacher what do you think could be done more for the young in South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A (30.21)&#9;</B>There’s very little in the way of communications for them, they find it difficult to get to places, I think the thing they need more than anything else is a good transport system.  To be able to get to Cirencester on the bus in the evening is almost an impossibility.  I think they can get there, but they can’t get back.  I think a good bus service would be a very good thing for the young, as it would for everyone.</P>

<B><P>Q (30.48)&#9;</B>Do you think a Cadet Corps?</P>
<B><P>A (30.52)</B>&#9;I was a stalwart of the Cadet Corps, but I’m not sure that it’s relevant in present society.&#9;</P>
<B>
<P>Q (31.06)&#9;</B>The South Cerney Trust…..?</P>
<B><P>A (31.08)&#9;</B>I’ve been a member since I first heard about it when I came to the village and I think it serves a very good cause in that it carries one of those watching briefs and a lot of voluntary organisations does in that it keeps it’s eye on planning applications, not in NIMBY way, but it certainly looks after, in a non-governmental way, the local amenities, but it also does very positive things as well and I suppose the highlight of it is the way our 1999 celebrations have been brought about by the activities of  the Trust.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q (31.57)&#9;</B>The Cotswold Water Park, what do you envisage should happen there?</P>
<B><P>A (32.03)&#9;</B>It’s an enormous resource.  The fact that there are so many activities happening on the water.  When you look at the area from above, the aerial view is solely water, it is quite staggering to see where we live when you look at it in that way, and when you look at all the activities of sailing and jet skiing and windsurfing and water skiing and so on, it really does look like a centre of leisure.  It’s also a very important environmental area when it comes to wildlife and particularly over-wintering birds and so on and it’s patently obvious to me that the whole area needs managing and whether that is a nature reserve I’m not sure.  I’m not sure that the scale is right as far as that’s concerned.   What does concern me is that a lot of these facilities don’t seem to be available to the ordinary local person and weekends is an influx of people, and I would like to see more of the Water Park opened up for more regular general use, but managed at the same time of course.  Since I’ve come to the village I’ve lost count of the number of house that have been built and it seems to be quite clear that South Cerney is actually extremely well placed if you look at it in one way in that we exactly halfway between the M4 a M5 motorways, so South Cerney is becoming a very useful place for people to live, who have to travel quite a lot that of course has different views, you might think that South Cerney is becoming a dormitory town or a large village and that is something that I wouldn’t like to see.  One of the village’s problems is that we are quite close to Cirencester, probably too close, if we were a little bit father away than people wouldn’t find it so easy to pop into Cirencester, there is a local debate as to whether the village ought to remain a village or to be a town.  The population is over 3,000, which is bigger that some small towns in the county, but those towns are generally more isolated and more self-supporting.  Most people in the village ant the village to remain the village, but if that’s the case I would like to see more village life and more village activities taking place to make it that, and I think most people would as well.  </P>
<B><P>&#9;</B>When we came to the village, both the children went to the local primary school, at the time our daughter was 9 and our son was 8, and from their they went to Kingshill, where I was teaching, so they did most of their schooling with their father not too far away, which they said was sometimes a good thing but generally speaking not such a good thing.  They did their GCSEs at Kingshill and then moved into the 6th form at that time it was a joint 6<SUP>th</SUP> form between Kingshill and Deer Park and they went to it and so did I, because for a number of years I was the liaison person to try and link the two schools together.  The result of it, is that the joint 6<SUP>th</SUP> form no longer exists.  It is now a further education college, it has progressed and takes in a wide area of students and is doing well.  Both my children did their ‘A’ levels in Cirencester.  One went to University in Bristol, one went to Worcester.  My daughter is now a maths teacher, the last job was in Tetbury, and my son is a software engineer in Oxford, so I suppose you could say they both did very well out of the local education system, as did an enormous lot of children.  I think as far as schools are concerned, I think we are very fortunate, and many of the village children are now making their fortunes or serving the country in various ways all over the world.  One of our local boys has now got his PhD and is now working in Canada, another one is doing very advanced cancer research work in London, so we’ve many success stories when it comes to the children in South Cerney.  </P>

<B><P>Q (37.20)&#9;</B>How do you see the role of the Parish Council?<B>&#9;</P>
<P>A (37.22)&#9;</B>I’ve been chairman of the Parish Council, vice chairman and various other positions since about 1992, and what I’ve seen is that the Parish Council’s role has increased as the County Council’s role has decreased.  It’s almost a common feature of the Parish Council meetings now  that whenever we have any communication with the County Council, and request for anything, the County Council’s rely is yes of course you can have it, but we can’t afford it, therefore if the Parish Council would like to pay for it then that will be fine.  I’m talking about things like highway improvement, street lighting, and so on.  So it seems to me that the Parish Council is taking more responsibility, not only in the duties aspect, but in the financial provision, so I see the very local government as being more important and as a result of that the Parish Council has been more proactive in the village and I think that will increase.  The County Council seems to be getting more remote and it has its hands tied behind its back by finances.  I think it’s quit an interesting time to be as far a local government is concerned, we get far more involved in planning issues as well and we are consulted more than in the past.  I think in the past the Parish Council really was just a crisis management organisation.  Usually if something went wrong it was the Parish Council’s fault and the Parish Council did something about it, or took the blame.  I think that is definitely changing.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (39.23)&#9;</B>How do people…………………(?) Parish Council?</P>
<B><P>A (39.27)&#9;</B>The Parish Council<B> </B>is elected every four years.  In many parishes there never is an election. We have 11 members of the parish council, and I think over the last 8 -12 years there always have been 11 candidates.  So we have had an election, quite a daunting activity for someone because they have had to elect 11 from say 13 and it’s done by placing the candidates in order of priority, so I think it is quite a difficult election in that sense, but I am very pleased to say we have had elections.  The next one is in 1999 in May.</P>
