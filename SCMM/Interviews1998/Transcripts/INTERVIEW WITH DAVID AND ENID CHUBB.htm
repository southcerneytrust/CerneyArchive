<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 12.30&#9;</B>Can you tell me your names first of all.</P>
</FONT><B><P>A 12.32&#9;</B>Enid Chubb and David Chubb</P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<B><P>Q 12.37</B>&#9;Were you both born and bred in South Cerney?</P>
</FONT><B><P>A 12.39 -E</B>&#9;I was born in South Cerney</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>A 12.40 -D</B>&#9;and I was born in the next village, Siddington</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 12.45</B>&#9;How long have you both lived here?</P>




<B><P>A 12.47 –E&#9;</B>I was born in a cottage that faces the river, at the bottom of School Lane just by Raymond’s house, my mother was born there too, we moved to the farm here when I was six, and my father farmed here.  When David and I first got married we lived in a cottage, then my father built a new house just below the cottages and we moved back to the farmhouse, and we’ve been here every since, 30 odd years ago.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 13.19</B>&#9;When did you come to South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 13.21 -D</B>&#9;When we got married, about 1963.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 13.32</B>&#9;Did you go to Ann Edwards School</P>
<B><P>A 13.35 – E</B>&#9;Yes, but when it was in School Lane at the old school..</P>
<B>
<P>Q 13.38</B>&#9;Can you remember anything about that, what it was like?</P>
<B><P>A 13.40 –E</B>&#9;Yes, it was quite nice.  It was all in a small building there then.  We had Miss Cole as our first teacher who I still sometimes see in Cirencester; she’s retired and lives in Cirencester.  Mr Peyman was the headmaster then, there was Mr Chambers and Miss Dunn.  We went to the village hall when we got into our last year at school we had our lessons in the village hall because there wasn’t enough room in the school.  Then I think they started at the school, he went to the old school for a little while then I think they just started at the new school afterwards.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 14.30&#9;</B>Do you remember the old cottage behind?</P>
<B><P>A 14.32 – E</B>&#9;Yes, I do but it was getting a bit dilapidated, I think it has been the schoolmaster’s cottage.  I can remember it being there, but it all look quite different now it’s completely gone.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 14.55</B>&#9;Do you remember anything about the old ladies in the College?</P>
<B><P>A 14.57 – E&#9;</B>The old ladies in the college, there was Miss Hall I remember and Miss Barratt, who used to walk around the village.  Miss Hall did some lovely paintings, some watercolours and things, some really pretty ones.  You can see quite a lot of them round the village in different people’s houses.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 15.24</B>&#9;Did you ever go to her classes for sewing?</P>
<B><P>A 15.26 -E</B>&#9;No I didn’t, I think my mother did, but I didn’t</P>

<B><P>Q 15.34</B>&#9;What do you both remember about the early days in South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 15.43 - E&#9;</B>We were both involved in the Flower Show.  I used to help my dad, because we had a gymkhana in those days and I used to write down ……..? so I used to help with that, and it was a very big show in those days because they had a big marquee and they used to have cycle races and fancy dress and I remember being on the floats with the Brownies and Guides.  It was a really big show then and they had some lovely floats and things. David drove the tractor once, because our daughter Tina was something in the Flower Show. <B>[D</B> – the tractor’s still in the shed and the trailers are still here.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 16.30</B>&#9;How long has your family been farming in this area?</P>
<B><P>A 16.35 –E</B>&#9;My father farmed at Cerney Wick with my grandfather and my grandfather originally bought the farm, as I say dad bought it when I was 6, and they farmed around here; I think grampy originally came from Braden down to Cerney Wick, and my mother was born in the cottage by the river so she has been here all her life.  Ray who lived at Berry Farm was my father’s cousin, and there was Norman who lived at Shorncote, he was my father’s cousin and Arthur was my father’s step brother and he lived at Cricklade, he has just retired now, he was at Cerney Wick then he moved to Cricklade.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 17.41</B>&#9;David your specialty is beekeeping, can you tell us a little bit about where you learned it?</P>
<B><P>A 17.49 – D</B>&#9;I started because I just like nature, and I like to see things, and one day there was a bumble bees’ nest underneath a stone round in the cottage and it started me thinking, perhaps it’s time I started keeping bees and from there on I’ve always kept them.  It was usually  collect up some string and paper bags from the cattle feed and take them along to the scrap yard and get a pound for them, then go and get another bee hive, that’s really how I began.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 18.35</B> &#9;Who taught you?</P>
<B><P>A 18.37 – D</B>&#9;Mostly I taught myself, but I belong to the beekeepers’ association, since it started round here and I’ve read a few of the books.  Mostly it was about doing things and finding how the bees reacted to it, because I find that when people write books they have read somebody else’s book and they have just added their bit too it, and quite often they don’t actually do it themselves.</P>

<B><P>Q 19.12</B>&#9;So what have you learned particularly?</P>
<B><P>A 19.14 -D</B>&#9;The bees know more than we do and they don’t read the books anyway.  The bees tended to react to different things, if there is a flow they will suddenly take off and really work hard, but when there is nothing coming in like now they are very idle, they don’t do anything at all it’s a matter of getting ready for it and anticipating that something will be happening in the next week and being ready to do something for them and that really is the key to successful bee keeping.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 20.02</B>&#9;So you are looking for weather signs as well as………….?</P>
<B><P>A 20.05</B>&#9;You know more or less when things are going to come in.  The lime will come in in July, the dandelion usually comes in April then it follows on to the sycamore and you know then that the bees are going to start building  up and a good flow this week means that in three weeks to six weeks time there’s going to be a lot of bees, and you have to allow for those bees and if the queen stops laying then you know in six weeks there won’t be so many bees, after they die off there will be less of them.  It’s probably been one of the worst years for bee keeping.  It wasn’t very good in May and it’s been wet through the summer and my bees seemed to have swarmed rather than collect honey.  I’ve been busy doing other things, it seems to be out of sequence this year for bee keeping and farming.  We’re still haymaking in September.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 21.19</B>&#9;Can you tell me what the cycle would be in a good year for bees?</P>
<B><P>A 21.22</B>&#9;They usually come out of the Winter, in early March or April; by April there should be about 8 frames of bees.  By mid-April you put the first supers on and then we usually go into the rape at the end of April, early May, and by that time you get your second super on and then you’ve got the dandelion and sycamore, you’ve got the chestnuts and the apples, pears come a little bit earlier and that takes you more or less through until the end of May, and then usually through June, unless there is something out in the field that you go to, because I often take my bees out to the field, there is very little.  Field bees usually come about June if there is nothing at home, and for the bees at home there is nothing until this area  until the lime comes in.  You may get a little bit of clover if the conditions are right through July, but when you get to the third week in July that is it for the season until the ivy comes in and garden flowers just help them along, but there’s not usually a flow.  Then it a matter of feeding them down and preparing for the winter.</P>

<B><P>Q 22.56</B>&#9;Do you make your own skeps at all?</P>
<B><P>A 23.04</B>&#9;I’ve been making skeps for the last 15 years.  It was just something that happened, I wanted a skep, because mine was broken and I asked around and no-one seemed to be doing them, so I got on to someone who I’d been buying some bee keeping books from and he said the only book there is is in Dutch, and I said well it that’s the best one there is, I’ll have that one.  I happened to have a book to be able to translate it into English, and I started translating it, but when I got to about two-thirds through, and I thought this is all very fine, but I can’t get their materials, and if I make what they want it won’t be of interest to me, so I decided I would have to find my own materials locally, so that was the first year.  The second year the brownies had a rummage sale out in the paddock and I saw somebody making so corn dollies, so I asked where they got their straw from, and he said I get it from work I look after the trial plots.  As soon as the students have gone for the summer holidays we can go and get what we want, because we’ve got to get rid of it anyway, so we go along and collect the straw and bring it back home and I said that’s fine, now what do I bind it with?  Officially it should be hazel or willow or bramble, but the bramble had been cut back by the frost quite badly so there was very little bramble about, the hazel, well we didn’t have a lot of hazel about, and the willow, not round here really, not the types of willow we need so I thought I’ll go and see the people who make cane chairs and see if they’ve got anything, and I managed to come back with a hank of rattan, which is more flexible than the ordinary materials that we used to use, so I sit down with my book and my straw and my cane and try and work out how I was going to make my skeps, and after an hour or two I managed to work how to make the first skep.  First of all I used a screwdriver to make a hole to go through and later I adapted and made tools for the job.  Then we went on holiday, I think we’ve had two weeks and one weekend’s holiday in the last 34 years.  We’ve enjoyed our life here we didn’t really want to go away.  I met up with someone we had been buying bee keeping equipment from and got talking to him, then I saw him again when I went up to London to the National Honey Show about a year later and I said what are you doing up here on this stand, and he said I’ve bought this bee keeping firm and I said do you want to buy a few skeps as well, and we started doing business and we’ve been doing business ever since.  There are two major firms in the country and I have been making them for both firms, then we’ve been doing some shows.  This year we’ve done Ann Hathaway’s Cottage for two days, we’ve done the Royal Show for two days, demonstrating skep making and we’re going to Mary Arden’s House, and this weekend it’s the Moreton Show and Lydiard Park this weekend and Cirencester Park for two days.  What we do is go round and demonstrate, and people say well you can bring your honey along and sell.  Really and truthfully you can’t sell your honey at one end of the table if you’re demonstrating, so I asked Enid if she would come along and sell the honey, but it wouldn’t be fair for her to come along just to sell the honey, so I said well if you have all the wax and what you make out of it you can have yourself, so Enid sells wax and candles and honey at one end and I demonstrate at the other, and it’s worked pretty well, but we did have an enquiry from America, who said they wanted some of these skeps, because they had picked up one of my leaflets at one of the shows, and so we’ve started dealing and sending those some skeps and then they wanted some candles as well so we put some candles inside the skeps .</P>

<B><P>Q 27.35</B>&#9;Is the fashion for reconstructing historic gardens something that ……?</P>
<B><P>A 27.45</B>&#9;It may do in America, they like their gardens and they like to put something, but it doesn’t seem to have had much effect in England, although because I go to Northleach, The Cotswold Countryside Collection, they encourage a lot of different crafts and one of them was someone doing photography, and he goes round the other collecting pictures and tries to sell these pictures to magazines, so we have been in one or two of the magazines, and this sometimes gets us on to making things for film sets and this sort of thing, but I’ve never really got into the garden, they seem to make more out of it than I do.  The theory is he makes money by selling the story to the magazine, then I should get a knock on effect of getting some business, but it doesn’t work like that.</P>

<B><P>Q 28.46</B>&#9;Enid, tell us about the candle making side of things</P>
<B><P>A 28.51 -E</B>&#9;As David said, he lets me have the wax and I make the candles.  I do find, to go to The States, they have to have the ones with bees, on.  I have a large skep candle and a smaller skep candle and one with the queen bee on, they seem to like candles that have bees on them and not just the bees wax.  Some of the others I make are just little animal shapes and things like that.  Or I have made candles for people for orders; one man wanted some very big ones to go in an old tythe barn by Withington, but they were difficult to make because they were rather heavy and they had a lean on them, but that was the way he said he wanted them.  They’re quite fun to do, but I have got myself a bigger tank now, so I find it much easier, before I used to use my little pot; I’ve got a big tank now which has water on the outside and you put wax on the inside; you have a nice lot of wax that is molten so you can do quite a lot of candles.  Some of the orders from the States come in for 500 of one sort at a time, so I did really outgrow my small pot, and having the tank was good, which I bought with my first money from my first order.  I thought I’ve got to have a big tank and do it properly. </P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 30.16</B>&#9;Tell me about the disease……you’ve had this disease………..?</P>
<B><P>A 30.22 –D</B>&#9;Bee keeping is under threat at the moment because of a disease they call …..? It is a little tiny mite like a flea and the bees go off into a hive or a colony which has this infection and this little mite runs from one bee to another and it’s carried back to the hive and there it jumps off and goes into one of the cells where the larvae are going to be born and it gets sealed over inside the cell and once it’s sealed over it lays its eggs on the larvae and it lives off the larvae and it sucks the juices of the larvae.  So one fertile female going in would be six fertile females coming out.  The problem is, if the bees pick up 100, you’ve got 600 within about a fortnight or so.  We can treat this, but as soon as the treatment is finished they can pick it up and start all over again the next day, so it is a serious problem to us.  I think somebody said that 600 colonies were lost in Gloucestershire, Hereford and Worcestershire so far by May this year because of this disease.  So it’s going to be serious for us for the next few years.  With colonies out in churches and roofs and that sort of thing they are always a source of infection and it’s a matter of being able to cope with it and living with it.  100 years ago it was Isle of Wight disease that was active that wiped out most of the bees, but it recovered, and the bees will recover again, we just have to learn to live with these things.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 32.07</B>&#9;If you get a strange swarm, I think traditionally you used to collect it didn’t you?</P>
<B><P>A 32.12 –D&#9;</B>We used to collect it and you can treat them as long as they are in a swarm, if you collect a swarm and put two plastic strips in for 24 hours you can kill of the mites, so it’s possible to still collect swarms, but it’s hives of bees left in people’s gardens and that sort of thing is difficult when it is inside the colony and in the frames and in with the worker or in with the drone brood, that’s when it gets a problem.  </P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 32.44</B>&#9;Do you lend out hives to apple growing orchards?</P>
<B><P>A 32.50&#9;</B>I have been going to the oil seed rape and the field<B> </B>….? For the last 20 years I suppose and this year was the first year I didn’t go, but things didn’t work out very well and apart from that we are running into a problem, with genetically engineered material and we had a bit of a do with that earlier on this year.  I was asked to sit on a panel for one of the BBC programmes and I went along because I thought I could learn a little bit more about it and talking to the scientists there they said it’s safe, and I said that’s fine.  They are producing a product which is a rape seed that is going to go into industry, but as I explained to them my bees are going to collect food that is actually going to go for human consumption, which to us is a serious problem, because at the end of the day the little bee keeper has to carry the can, whereas the big firms can just walk away.  This for us is going to be serious, although I’ve lately heard of a spray that’s coming in which they can spray so the bees wouldn’t even work the oil seed rape, so that is the next stage, and perhaps in that way we can keep looking until they find an answer to it, because if you put something on to the plant or change the plant there could easily be a serious problem, because genetically engineered thing is taking apart another plant; as an example, Icelandic cod in tomatoes, it sounds impossible, but that’s what’s being done.</P>
<P>We usually produce probably eight or nine hundred pounds a year, could be a little bit more.  This year I’ve no idea, it’ll probably be half of that, we’re going to be down a lot this year, but I don’t know yet because I haven’t collected it in.  The bees aren’t doing as well this year and the colonies all the way round.  Actually I am put down as a commercial beekeeper, because I belong to the Bee Farmers Association as well, so I get an idea of what goes on and I think all the way round it’s going to be down.  If we get four or five hundredweight this year, we won’t be far out I suppose. </P>





<B><P>Q 35.49&#9;</B>&#9;Have you ever tried making mead?</P>




<B><P>A 35.50 –D</B>&#9;Yes, but I don’t drink, so it’s no good producing something if you don’t want it.  I got a bottle in the cupboard now, it really needs to be about 7 years old, but that’s about 10 or 15.  I was hoping to make some for the millennium, but I didn’t get round to it, perhaps I will have to get the bottle out.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 36.19</B>&#9;How long does it take to make it?</P>
<B><P>A 36.21 –D</B>&#9;The monks used to make the mead then bury it for 7 years before they drank it, but you could make it and drink it within 6 – 8 months. </P>
<B>
<P>Q36.43</B>&#9;Can you tell me how much weight on the average year…. wax? </P>
<B><P>A 36.49 - E</B>&#9;Bees wax? I gobbled up David’s bees wax because I made a lot of candles for the States, and I had to go and get some more from a commercial bee keeper, that was 6 about hundredweight. When I was doing a lot to go to the States.  We have done it for three years to go to the States.  Their main season is about from November round through to about March/April time.  They have just faxed us and said could we send in our prices for the coming season, which was from November to round again, which we have just done, but I think they send their catalogues out in September, about now.  That’s where a lot of the wax goes.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 37.51&#9;</B>Do you add any kind of perfume to them?</P>
<B><P>A 37.53</B>&#9;No, I don’t, I find most people just like bees wax candles made of the bees wax.  Occasionally I am asked to do coloured ones, or sometimes if I am doing flowers I may do some red ones, or add a bit of colour to the bees wax, but mostly people just like them the way they are and like the smell of the bees wax naturally.  Occasionally I have perfumed some roses and things like that if people have asked me to, but people just generally want them in the plain bees’ wax colour.</P>

<B><P>Q 38.33</B>&#9;Tell me………………?</P>
<B><P>A 38.39 –D</B>&#9;When the bee thing actually hit a few years ago, we had one animal that was one day too old, was one day over 30 months and we had 2 animals that were 2 days too old, so instead of them being able to go into market, we had to keep them from April through to until September and it was after that and the Vir…..(?)   To me it’s similar because it’s a food product and this is probably why I reacted the way I do to …….(?)   consider it’s going to come, it’s going to take its toll and we will have to pick up the pieces at the end and start putting things back together again.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 39.23</B>&#9;How much has farming been affected by the ………………?</P>
<B><P>A 39.30 –D&#9;</B>Well this farm, we used to go down to the education pit, and we can sit down there and say in 1960 we were riding the tractor up and down here.  The little Ferguson that’s in the shed would have been chain harrowing at the part of what is now the education pit, so that’s part of the farm went.  Rainbow Lake is one that we had dug out and I remember mowing and haymaking down in there.  I came to help out in 1963/64 and we brought the cows down here from Box Bush, down over the railway bridge into where Rainbow Lake is now and we also used to walk them up past the old post office and past the old garage, past the war memorial, down Broadway Lane into a little paddock down there.  So we used to walk the cattle all through the village at one stage.  What started to happen was, people came in and they wanted open plan so they didn’t have any gates, they didn’t have any fences, and it started to get difficult.  And today it is difficult to walk animals through the village, but as my father-in-law sold pieces of land off so we bought land that was further away.  At one stage we were probably up to nearly 200 acres, today we’re down to 20 acres, and if we want any land we’ve got to go 2 miles at least; so it’s a matter of travelling backwards and forwards.  Most of the land I rent at the moment to keep the farm going, but for how long I don’t know.  They don’t want farmers anymore anyway.  All the Box Bush Estate here we used to walk the cattle down there right to the station.  Robert Franklin Way was part of Enid’s uncle’s patch so we used to feed that one off as well all through Robert Franklin Way.  The next piece of land used to belong to Mrs ……? at Butler’s Court, and we used to go through that one and right the way back up to the farm and fed it all off. We’ve seen it all be developed.  It was nice when they started, because you thought people are going to have houses and a decent way of life and a piece of garden where the children could expand and grow, but what I have found is the more development they have put into it the closer and closer the houses went together.  In the earlier houses if they had a big enough garden, they just put another house in. So people just don’t want the space, it’s a shame really, but the children in the future are so enclosed and their lives are so – they really need to expand and develop and they’re not allowed to do that anymore.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 42.47</B>&#9;How many children have you got?</P>
<B><P>A 42.498 – E</B>&#9;Two, a son and a daughter.  Adrian is now 33 and Tina is 30.  They were both born in this house, because my mother lived here and I came back, David and I lived at the cottage, but I came back home with mum and had the children; we had a lovely district nurse then and I thought it would be nice to stay home and have them, so I did, both of them.  Adrian now works for a firm of Agricultural engineers in Cirencester, mending tractors and all the machinery, and Tina has just finished doing a BA course down in Carmarthen, and is hoping to go on to do teacher training.  She did 7 years at the vets in Cirencester as a veterinary nurse, and then decided to do something completely different, so she went to college in Swindon to start with for her first year, then she did three years in Wales.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 43.57</B>&#9;………….Brown owl………tell me about it?</P>
<B><P>A 44.05 –E</B>&#9;I’m a Brown Owl with the Brownies, when I started doing Brownies I took over from Raymond’s mother, I did help Jean for a couple for years, then she went away, and then I took over from there.  I really took it on so Tina could be a Brownie, but I’ve been doing it for 23 or 24 years now.  I’ve really enjoyed doing it, and now I see some of the girls who were Brownies in the village or in Cirencester with their little ones, and it seems that they’ve all grown up and I think I must have been doing it a long time.  When we first started off we carried on in Raymond’s stables, then we went to the village hall and we’ve been in the village hall ever since.  I remember Raymond’s mother being my Brown Owl, and all the things that we did, it really hasn’t changed that much.  I’ve got some really good help at the moment, which is great, as at one time I struggled on my own, but now I’ve got some really good help.  It is very popular, and we have got a very long waiting list.</P>

<B><P>Q 45.42</B>&#9;Do they go off for camps?</P>
<B><P>A 45.44</B>&#9;Actually I didn’t take them this year, because I can’t find the time, but …….? who helps me, took them off on Pack Holiday to Macaroni Woods, which is over by Eastleach and they had a lovely time.  I went over on the Saturday and saw them.  They really enjoyed themselves.  </P>

<B><P>47.45 –D</B> &#9;We went to a show at Lydiard Park and we happened to have a coracle maker one side and a hurdle maker the other, then a pole lathe man, then we went to the Mill up by Stratford and there was another coracle maker one side and a thatcher the other side and the pole lathe was a bit further down, and the fletcher was further down still, making arrows and these are the sort of things that we do.  When you go to a craft fayre; our sort of craft fayre and you can have a chair maker and you can have a potter and a basket maker and you’re in with this crowd all the time, so this is one of the reasons why we like to go out and demonstrate skep making and candle making because we meet up with all the other crafts, old crafts mostly.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 48.38</B>&#9;Is there a cane chair maker still?</P>
<B><P>A 50.12 –E</B>   &#9;There is a man who makes chairs and does rush seating, he lives in Silver Street, Mr Spriggs is his name.  We’ve often seen him when we’ve been to craft fayres, he’s usually with the Cotswold Countryside Collection form Northleach, and we will probably see him when we go to Moreton Show next week.</P>

<B><P>50.44 –E</B>&#9;Yes I remember the railway station very well, because my grandfather used to work in the signal box, and I can remember as a little girl going down there and seeing him.  My mother very often used to take his lunch down and I’d see the trains coming in and go to the signal box to see him moving the signals.  He had worked there for a long time, then he retired and then war came and so he went back there as signal man, and I can remember lots of trains going through, straight down to Southampton, I believe my mother said.  I can remember the signal box being there, it seemed so sad when it all went.  When I was 3 my grandfather bought me a little clockwork train set, which I had to have, I’ve still got it up in the attic.  I can remember it was very like the trains that used to come through because of the GWR colours, the green and gold and I can remember the engine coming through like that.  Sometimes when I was down there if we knew the train driver he would let me sit inside and see all the dials and things, it was lovely, I’ve always liked steam engines, there was something rather lovely about them.  It was rather sad when the last one came through.  We went and saw the last train go through, but I felt, my grandfather had died the year before, he would have been very sad to have actually have seen the last train go through.  Then after that it was all demolished, and that was the end of  it.</P>

<B><P>Q 53.02</B>&#9;Do you remember any particular journeys?</P>
<B><P>A 53.03</B>&#9;No, I remember going with my mother into Cirencester, and you’d just get on here and off at Watermoor Station, I think we may have been down to Weston, to the seaside, once or twice which was nice.  </P>

<B><P>Q 53.26&#9;</B>Did you get married in All Hallows?</P>
<B><P>A 53.28</B>&#9;Yes we did 34 years ago.  It doesn’t seem that long.  The sun shone and Raymond played the organ.  My parents were also married in the church up here.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>54.35 – D</B>&#9;I used to keep some bees down at Crane Farm and I used to go down mostly on a Sunday morning, and I would go in and have a glass of sherry or some scrumpy cider which as long as you didn’t breathe at the same time it was all right.  Tom used to say that his grandfather, great grandfather I think it was, came through when they built the railway, and he was in charge of a gang and just out of the village there.   I think one of the gangs went broke because they didn’t realise how hard the rock was going to be.  If you go up there I think you can still see the holes they drilled to blast the rock off, but them Tom’s father went down to Crane Farm and they used to have a coal round, but I think the Co-op came in and took over and pushed them out.  Tom then went into the building trade, he’d get up at 5 o’clock in the morning and milk his three heifers then he would set off on his bike to go to work.  Work was in Swindon, building houses, he would get there about 8 o’clock and then they’d say there’s no work today, so he would cycle back again.  And then Saturdays it would be a game of football, he was a very active sort of person.  He was about 65 when he had his leg off, but he’d still use his scythe to cut his hay and make his ricks and go down into the canal to cut some reeds to thatch it with, I’ve got a picture of one of his ricks.  He loved his garden, he always used to get on digging his garden.  He’d often have a couple of cows and they would probably be about 3 years old, but he found that they got too big for him, only having one leg he found it difficult to balance, especially climbing ladders, he found it very difficult climbing ladders with only one leg.  So he had to cut back, so we used to rent the fields off him and make a bit of hay for him, we had bailed hay instead of a hayrick.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 56.46</B>&#9;He had wonderful flowers down there……………..</P>
<B><P>A 56.49 –D</B>&#9;There were a lot of orchids down there and a lot of them went when they dug it up.  It was untouched most of that land before, but if the will had been allowed to be carried out, then it would have been kept preserved, but because there was money involved and they thought they could gravel it and make some money out of it.  There was a squabble over the land and of course they dug it all up, it was such a shame really.  I remember one day I went down there, and he had lost a tree, a tree had blown over and he said just cut the top out of it, push it back up again, it will grow, and the branches he would plant along the side of the ditch and they’d all grow into trees, and that’s the sort of person he was.  A very generous sort of person, and I got on with him very well.</P>

<B><P>Q 57.45&#9;</B>What happened to all his old rakes and things?</P>
<B><P>A 57.50</B>&#9;I don’t know where they went, he had a nice plough down there, but they just got left behind, they disappeared.  Once Tom died and it was sold I didn’t go back down.  I was asked to take the bees away and that was it.</P>

<B><P>Q 58.05</B>&#9;What happened to the cat?</P>
<B><P>A 58.07</B>&#9;I don’t know what happened to the cat or the dog.</P>

<B><P>00.08 – D&#9;</B>I worked in Watermoor yard for 2 or 3 days, we came over to lift the crossing, I was on the length at Kemble and then as this closed down so we were asked to come and do some work over here, then I was sent out on to the Tetbury branch, just before that closed, because no one else would go out there.  Well no one wanted to go out there, when the gang came back from Tetbury I went to Purton for a bit, then they asked me to go to Swindon, they said well you can either go to Bristol or pack up, so I thought this is time to pack up, so I packed up, and then I took a job down at Bradleys then, loading gravel, and I came home one day, and my father-in-law was in a bit of a state because he had had a row with the cowman, and I said well I’ll come and help out for a bit, then stayed on for 24 years.</P>
<B><P>&#9;</B>My father worked on this length just after the war, he was killed on this length, Enid’s grandfather was in the signal box this end.  </P>

<B><P>Q 01.30</B>&#9;Was he run over?</P>
<B><P>A 01.32 – E&#9;</B>Yes, it was a windy day.</P>
<B><P>A 01.47 – D</B> &#9;We both come from railway families.  Because my grandfather was up on the platform in Swindon from about 1909, until the Second World War.  </P>

<B><P>Q 02.12</B>&#9;Do either of you remember any of the old singers, because there were people, Charles Messenger for instance from Cerney Wick?</P>
<B><P>A 02.21 -E</B>&#9;I’ve heard my father talk of him, but I didn’t know him.  I’ve heard dad talk of him but I didn’t know him myself.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 02.30&#9;</B>What did your dad say about him?</P>
<B><P>A 02.33 -E&#9;</B>I just remember he sued to sing, but I don’t recall very much about<B> </B>him.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 02.46&#9;</B>Have you heard of the mumming play?</P>
<B><P>A 02.49 -E&#9;</B>I’ve heard of it, yes.  I’ve heard mum and dad talk of it, but personally I don’t know much about it.  It was a special play I believe attributed to South Cerney.  David only knows the Siddington one, I’m sure I’ve seen it done but I don’t know too much about it, it’s traditional isn’t it?</P>
<B>
<P>A 03.18 – D</B>&#9;In comes I old Father Christmas, in comes I to mak the fun, me hair is short me beard in long, me ‘at’s tied on with leather and thong.   Merry Christmas one and all.   I can’t remember the name of the other person that wants to fight Father Christmas, anyway there is this battle and Father Christmas is killed.  Is there a doctor in the house, doctor, doctor, this man is ill, dead I think.  Boy fetch me my bag.  Shan’t.  Boy fetch me my bag. Shan’t.  Fetch me my bag.  Come in doctor.  Boy fetch me my medicine.  Shan’t. Boy fetch me my medicine.  Shan’t. Boy fetch me my medicine.  Come in doctor.  Exactly the same as South Cerney, and of course I was the tail end Charlie.  In comes I old Vinder Wit with my gert yud and my little wit, my ‘ead’s so big, my wit’s so small as I brought my fiddle to please you all, what tune would you like ladies and gentlemen?  And you’d play the Archers or something like that.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 04.20</B>&#9;How many performances did you do in an evening?</P>
<B><P>A 04.23-D&#9;</B>We<B> </B>only did one and that was in the cubs, in the Bingham Hall I think, I forget where is was, because it was Alfie Cobb who used to do it in Siddington.  They used to run what there was to be run in Siddington at the time.  That’s how me met, because they did this jig at weekends on a Saturday night.  Records or something or Alfie on his fiddle, it was the only music there was, it was either that or nothing.  If you haven’t met Trump Taylor, he had a bullet on the shelf, and he reckoned that was the one that was up the breach of the gun in the First World War of the German who was pointing a gun at him, but he shot him.  He worked on the railway for a long time.  He used to live in a little cottage just opposite the farm here.  There was a Mr Edwards who lived next door, he was very annoyed because he came back, like a lot of them came back from the First World War, and he was supposed to have an acre of land and a cow, and he never had his acre of land and a cow and he wondered why he didn’t get it.  That’s how much you can trust the Government.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 06.25</B>&#9;Do you remember the farm that was demolished?</P>
<B><P>A 06.26 -E</B>&#9;Yes.  Where Mr Garratt lived.  Mr Garratt farmed that, and when we lived at the cottage we looked straight across at where there is Willow Grove now.  There was a farmhouse and a very old barn which used to look almost a cottage, and I can remember when they were knocking it down</P>
<B><P>&#9;</B>Adrian was very little and he used to like sitting in the window and see the man with the JCB knocking down the cottage.  When David used to come home for his lunch he very often used to take him over to see the man, and he thought it was marvellous to sit up on the JCB and turn the steering wheel.  It was all rather sad because it was a very nice old barn by the side of the road.  I found a picture the other evening of an old cat we had sitting on the wall, and there was the barn and the old farmhouse as it used to be, and seeing it in the picture, it brings it all back of how it used to be.  It’s very hard to visualise it now there’s Willow Grove and all the houses there now.</P>

<B><P>Q 07.39</B>&#9;Can you tell me anything about Berry Farm’s history?</P>
<B><P>A 07.42 -E</B>&#9;I don’t know very much about it’s history. I know it’s very old, Ray’s father, Frank, farmed it before Ray did, he was my father’s cousin.  And Frank, I think he bought it, but I don’t know who had it before then.  Obviously the house is very old and I don’t know much about the history of it.  </P>

<B><P>Q 08.19</B>&#9;Who’s farming it now?</P>
<B><P>A 08.22 – E</B>&#9;Joan and Carol, I believe.  Richard, who worked for Ray, actually runs the farm. but Joan is still there.  It is old inside, I don’t know much of it’s history.</P>
