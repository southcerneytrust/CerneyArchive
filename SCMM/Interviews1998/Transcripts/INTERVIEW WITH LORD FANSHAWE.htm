<B>
<P>Q (13.22)&#9;</B>What actually brought you to South Cerney?</P>




<B><P>A (13.23)</B>&#9;I think the feeling that we wanted to get away from London. At the time I was representing Richmond as a Member of Parliament and it did enable one to get out and away into a completely refreshing atmosphere, after the hard work of Westminster every day of the week.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (13.49)&#9;</B>And you started looking for houses in this area?</P>
<B><P>A (13.50)&#9;</B>We started looking in this direction, we had a lot of friends in the area and so decided to more here and this house just happened to suit us.  It was quite interesting that on the day we came to look at the house, Maurice Macmillan, who was Harold Macmillan’s son, was also looking at the house and they decided it was much to small for them and went off and bought a place called Highgrove, which after pulling down a wing, the Prince of Wales bought from them.  In those days, the prices were quite interesting.  The price being asked for this property here was in the region of £20,000 and Highgrove was on the market for £80,000.  I believe that the Prince of Wales was reputed to have paid about a million and a half for Highgrove when he bought it.  It shows how prices have gone up in this area.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q (14.52)</B>&#9;What is the history of the house?  Why is it called Chapter Manor?</P>
<B><P>A  (14.55)&#9;</B>As far as I can discover there are three manors in South Cerney, and of course a manor is a parcel of land, it’s not actually a house and this was one of the three manors and it remained as a manor owned by the Abbey in Cirencester until the Reformation, and in the 16<SUP>th</SUP> century and when Reformation came, the house and the land round it was taken away from the Abbey and was put into the hands of the new diocese of Bristol and became owned by the Dean and Chapter of Bristol Cathedral and the house was then called Chapter Manor.  Over a period of years it changed its name again at the turn of the century, but that was the origin of it.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (16.02)&#9;</B>How did you get to hear about the threat to the college?</P>
<B><P>A (16.09)</B>&#9;I can’t remember exactly how I heard about it, but I think I was talking to someone who was involved in the diocese in Gloucester and the College is still owned, I believe, by the diocese in Gloucester and I then heard from I think it was subsequently the Lord Lieutenant, Tim Gibbs, who was I think chairman of the Diocese the Board of Finance.  He gave me to understand the plan was to sell the whole of the College and with the proceeds build some alms houses in Gloucester, and that would have entailed pulling down the College itself.  When this was told to me I protested and subsequently took action to try and stop it.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (17.00)&#9;</B>What did you do?</P>
<B><P>A (17.01)&#9;</B>I got the place listed overnight really, and as a result of being listed it can’t ever be pulled down, so I think that has safeguarded it for good.  I don’t think the Diocese and the Board of Finance were best pleased with me.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (17.19)</B>&#9;……………?Tell us why you chose to be called South Cerney instead of Hertfordshire or something like that?</P>
<B><P>A (17.35)</B>&#9;Because we have been living here now for 35 years.  It was 15 years ago, we had been here for some considerable time and I wanted to have the link commemorated with the village in which I lived.  I didn’t make myself, or suggest that I should be Lord Fanshawe South Cerney, because of the reasons you explained, as I was a member for Richmond.  It was through being a member for Richmond that I became a peer, so I thought it was right to put that in my title.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (18.12)&#9;</B>Am I right in saying that you have had some very distinguished people here, including someone from China?</P>
<B><P>A (18.17)</B>&#9;In 1973 I think it was, accompanied by the Chairman of the Parish Council we received the Foreign Minister for the Chinese People’s Republic, who came over here originally with a plan to fly in Concorde, which was being tested at that time at Fairford and he arrived here with all his entourage. Much to our surprise however, he decided at the last minute not to fly, but to look at it in a static position on the ground and al his minions with him were most upset and there must have been at least 20 or 30 of them, because of course they couldn’t go up in Concorde if their minister wasn’t prepared to go.  The only reason he wasn’t prepared to go was nervousness, I gather, I don’t think there was any other reason.  Although at that time the Chinese People’s Republic were considering buying Concorde and we had discussions with them on the subject, but it all fell through.  It was a very jolly time.  One of our dogs then was a Pekinese and he behaved with the utmost credibility by doing all the right things and making all the right noises when out Chinese friends were here.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (19.29)&#9;</B>Was it a good place to bring up children?</P>
<B><P>A (19.32)&#9;</B>Yes marvellous, you had to be a bit careful with the river.  Very small children falling in rivers is not very attractive.  Otherwise a marvellous place.  Helen Dorling, who lived in South Cerney, and her father who ran the shop, which has now been taken back into private ownership, she used to run part of her riding school here when we first got here, certainly for three or four years, and of course the place was full of children, and with ponies being around made it very enjoyable for them.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q (20.02)&#9;</B>Is there anything else that you would like to tell us about?</P>
<B><P>A (20.12)&#9;</B>I think the fascinating thing about South Cerney is the river which runs right through it.  And the millstream I think was probably built in the 18<SUP>th</SUP> Century, and is certainly a part of the village that is enjoyed by everybody I think who walks through.  We in fact bought some extra land here, when we first came here we had about 14 acres.   Old Mrs Gibbs, who used to live in the Manor House, she moved into what is now the vicarage, and when she moved into the vicarage they decided to sell off the land, fields around it, and I was fortunate enough to be able buy it off her son, and this was really a range of parkland round the house, which was very agreeable for us, but even better for those who live in Edwards College who look out over it and it’s very enjoyable.  The other thing we did was to put in an avenue of Chestnut trees which has now been there for 20 years, and are well established and growing well, and I think this has made the parkland even more attractive.</P>
<B>
<P>Q (21.33)&#9;</B>Are they in memory of someone?</P>
<B><P>A (21.35)&#9;</B>Yes, they are in memory of our children’s nanny who lived here with us, and she died in 1978 and she left some money to be spent on the estate and we decided the nice thing to do was to put this avenue in in her memory and there’s a stone on the main gate making this clear.</P>
<B><P>&#9;</B>The other thing which I think is rather exciting is that between the two World Wars there was quite a considerable organisation of a bowling green and a bowling green club in the Downings.  Unfortunately during the 2<SUP>nd</SUP> World War this was abandoned and when we came here in 1965 it was just a rough field really, and running across the field was a huge avenue of elm trees, subsequently died of elm disease in the early 70’s and about 7 or 8 years ago I was approached by various people in the village to ask if I was prepared to help reinstate the bowling green and I said I would be delighted to do that, and so I handed over on loan the area of the Downings which made a very nice bowling green on the basis and on the place of where the old one was and now it now has a membership of about 40 people and I am the president of the club.  And the bowling green is one of the best in Gloucestershire.  It certainly has been a great success and much appreciated by a lot of the older people who live in the village.</P>

<B><P>Q (23.36)</B>&#9;I think you have also have events here for the COSY club?</P>
<B><P>A (20.40)</B>&#9;Oh yes, the cosy club usually come every year, and I think they are having their 40<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary this year. <B>&#9;</P>
<P>&#9;</B>In the early 18<SUP>th</SUP> Century this house was L shaped and really quite small.  They added on to it later on towards the end of the last century.  But in 1710 they redecorated the drawing room here with plasterers who had come over from Italy to work on Barnsley Park, and they were responsible for plasterwork on the main hall at Barnsley Park and when at some time or other they didn’t have enough time to do Barnsley, they came over to do this house and did the plasterwork here which is very unusual, and one of the reasons why the house is listed.  It was an interesting work that they did particularly interesting because at that time Barnsley Park was also owned by the Diocese in Bristol and so when the Diocese in Bristol decided they would like to do some plasterwork in their small little manor in South Cerney, this was done.  It’s really quite unusual and very rare. </P>
