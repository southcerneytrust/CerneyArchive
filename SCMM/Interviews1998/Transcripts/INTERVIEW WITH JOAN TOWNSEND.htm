<B><U>
</U><P>Q 18.58</B>&#9;Where were you born?</P>
<B><P>A 18.59</B>&#9;Blackburn in Lancashire</P>

<B><P>Q 19.06</B>&#9;How did you get to South Cerney?</P>




<B><P>A 19.07</B>&#9;My parents lived in a little village called Caudle Green with is near Birdlip, and my mother went back to her parental home to give birth to me, then I ended up back in Caudle Green, via school in Cirencester, back to Cheltenham then married and then moved to South Cerney 32 years ago in ten days time, in September when I got married.</P>





<B><P>Q 19.52</B>&#9;When did you first start with this office?&#9;</P>




<B><P>A  19.55</B>&#9;We joined with the United Church about 8 years ago I think, and then the office work was done up here.  Total restoration really, moved the stairs around and rebuilt the upstairs area which was totally derelict, and then the office open about 18 months after that, but I started working up here more or less full time about 7 years ago, before that we were working out of John’s study, but it is better if you are working efficiently to be working on your own, and the parish know where to find you because it is nice and central.  We have the door open for hour a day, that’s Wednesday and Thursday mornings and people just drop in to book baptisms to check on wedding just to find out different things they need to know.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 20.15</B>&#9;How many parishes?</P>
<B><P>A 20.55</B>&#9;We cover, it’s a benefice of three churches, the parish South Cerney with Cerney Wick and Down Ampney, so Down Ampney is a parish within itself.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 21.10</B>&#9;Tell me what you have to do in this office on an average day?</P>
<B><P>A 21.15</B>&#9;On an average day, the first thing I do when I come in is check the answer phone and any mail and see what people want and respond to the calls which is usually can I get married on such and such a day, or can I get my child baptised on such and such a day, then I either ring them back or send off the necessary paperwork.  Usually booking weddings is about six weeks before the wedding or a year and half before the wedding, so you are either all of a rush, or trying to put the brakes on a little bit.  If it’s baptisms especially, you have to phone them back and usually explain to them it isn’t just a case of booking the church and bringing your baby along because we do a course of baptism preparations which both parents come along to, and it’s explaining that sort of thing to them.  And dealing with anything else, undertakers that ring up, people that want to know who’s taking specific services, collecting messages for the vicar, making out registers, which is interesting, and anything else that turns up. Producing the weekly news sheet, which we do for all three churches every week, so that takes a bit of time producing and actually duplicating that.  </P>

<B><P>Q 22.50</B>&#9;Tell me about the registers……………………..?</P>
<B><P>A 22.54</B>&#9;For a marriage for instance, you have to make out the register three times, well there are two registers, one which we both keep here until the books are full and then one goes off to the archives, and then there is the marriage certificate that is signed up after the couple get married, and then once every three months I have to copy all these out and send the copy to the registrar in Cirencester, so if they have any queries they have an exact copy of all that have taken place in all three churches with regard to the registers.   Burial registers exactly the same, you have to make a copy and it goes on historical record, fascinating reading especially the burial one, how the things have changed over the year, and how ages have altered over the years.  The burial and the baptism registers at Down Ampney go back a very long way, I think the baptism register at Down Ampney goes back to 1880, so I am writing in something that is history, past history and future in my writing, which is quite daunting really.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 24.20</B>&#9;How old are the registers for South Cerney and Cerney Wick?</P>
<B><P>A 24.22</B>&#9;Cerney Wick don’t have their own registers, we write in our register, but specify that it goes to Cerney Wick and belongs to Cerney Wick church, they don’t have their own registers because they belong to the same parish.  And they are only what is called  chapel of ease they are not a church in their own right.  Our registers aren’t quite so old because obviously it’s a bigger church and a bigger village and more has gone on so the turnover is greater, so we don’t go back very far, 30’s 40’s I suppose, maybe even later than that.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 25.11</B>&#9;You don’t know what the earliest register is that they have in the record office in South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 25.19&#9;</B>No I don’t.  </P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 25.24</B>&#9;What do you do for the bereaved?</P>
<B><P>A 25.26</B>&#9;What do I do? I don’t very often get the bereaved as such, coming here, only once since I’ve been working here have I had someone come in who has just been bereaved and wants to know what to do and where to go.  Usually they go straight to the undertaker, which personally I think is a pity because I think if the direct line was to the parish priest, it that’s where you want the funeral to take place, it would be less business like.  Undertakers, although they are very caring, they are a business and I think it would be much nicer if they came here and found out what options were open to them.  There is a choice of undertakers, there is a choice of the ways you can do things, there is a choice of types of service you can have, as I have said because undertakes are a business, although they are not going in there, and least I hope they are not going in there and being mercenary, they are there to make a profit at the end of the day, so it would be nice if people would come here first and find out what options are open.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 26.45</B>&#9;When people sometimes are severely ill; if they want to pray for somebody who is ill what happens?</P>
<B><P>A 26.58</B>&#9;I’m not sure what you mean, but in the sense that if I hear of someone who is seriously ill in hospital and people notify me, I in turn notify John or find a priest that is available to go to visit.  We do have a system whereby we have a prayer list on the bottom of the weekly info, for people to pray during the week for people who specifically requested.  We don’t put people’s names on unless they have been requested, but there are specific names of people of families who would like their particular relative prayed for, there is also, at the entrance to All Hallows Church, where people can put requests for prayer and they are used at special prayer sessions on Wednesday of every week.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 27.59</B>&#9;Of the certain festivals in the church, does this involve you any special….?</P>
<B><P>A 28.05</B>&#9;What in the service taking capacity?  Me personally, Christmas and Easter I am a member of the choir, so that involves me in that sense, I am also a member of the local ministry team, so I’m now involved in taking certain services, so in that way I get involved, on the other side of it if we want to specifically publicise things I do a lot of the publicity and the artwork for the publicity so it involves me also in that way.  All these things usually aren’t generated through the office they’re personal involvement.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 28.54</B>&#9;Does this play a role in the village?</P>
<B><P>A 29.00&#9;</B>This office, because it is central in the village, and it’s handy because people pop to the Post Office or the garage or something, they can just pop into the office and get any information they want and pass on messages.  We are open only a couple of mornings a week, but we hope eventually the whole village will get used to us being here and they will know when we are here and we will be a focal point in the village so people know they can come here and get what information they need and we will be the church in the centre of the village, because although the church isn’t far from the centre of the village it is slightly tucked out of the way and the vicarage is tucked even further out of the way.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 29.51</B>&#9;You spoke that you were united with the United Church.  I understand that the minister there is abroad you have had an exchange, has that been interesting?</P>
<B><P>A 30.09&#9;</B>We’ve got a United management committee<B>,</B> which meets together and organises the running of the building and the maintenance of the building which is, as with all new things there are a few little hiccups, but with regard to the services we have begun sharing services, we had a super one when an American preacher was over here, and we had one on Palm Sunday which started here and ended up in All Hallows Church, which was really good.  We’ve got things organised for the future, but we’re not quite sure which services yet, but we want to join obviously more so we are not duplicating all the time, and we can unite as a congregation and become Christians within South Cerney.  We’ve got an ecumenical group which has started, a very slow take off, but hopefully it will get there, whereby all Christians can work together, worship together, pray together and be a focal point in the village.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 31.18</B>&#9;What did your United Minister learn …………………America?</P>
<B><P>A 31.26</B>&#9;I haven’t actually spoken to him since he’s been back, he only came back about a week ago.</P>

</FONT><B><P>Q 31.31</B>&#9;You mentioned that you were part of the ministry yourself, are you working towards ordination?</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>A 31.38</B>&#9;No, about 3 years ago it was decided by the PCC, they would like a local ministry team.  A local ministry team is made up of people selected by the congregation and includes a lay reader and the vicar, and they train over 3 years and work together in doing all sorts within the parish, whatever they want to do, assisting with baptism preparation, whether it be visiting or helping with services.  But to be seen to be ministering within the parish, because there’s only one vicar and there’s an awful lot of people out there, and his work hours get, the work that has to be done and the time that he’s got he needs more help and this help has to come from the lay people of the village so the ministry team has been training over 3 years and in November they get mandated in Gloucester Cathedral and carry on training for a little bit, they have extra courses over the next year, they are then sanctioned to work within the parish for three years, then we go back to the PCC and ask if they want us to continue or do they want different people to start training, but hopefully the people who have been training will carry on doing things in the parish, but under a different heading.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 33.31</B>&#9;What is the role of the PCC in the village, can you talk a bit………..?</P>
<B><P>A 33.40</B>&#9;The PCC are elected once a year by the members of the congregation who are on the electoral roll.  They oversee things that are going on they make sure the funds are kept up.  They are like the management committee I suppose.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 34.42</B>&#9;Who supervises the maintenance of the church fabric?  </P>
<B><P>A 35.45</B>&#9;The church fabric is looked after primarily by the church wardens, one of whom is elected by the village the other church warden is chosen by the vicar, but they are then elected by the people who are on the church electoral roll at the annual meeting of the PCC and they keep an eye on the fabric and report to the Parochial Church Council on what needs doing, and if things needs doing and funds need raising the PCC look at ways to do it as well as looking at how the general church services are run and what is going on, what the vicar is doing.  They keep an eye on things is the best way to describe it.</P>

<B><P>Q 35.45</B>&#9;What other things does the Parochial Church Council do?</P>
<B><P>A 35.50</B>&#9;In South Cerney we have meetings once a month where we discuss things we have discussed three months before, come to the same conclusions and still do nothing about it.  At the moment the PCC have been discussing what to do about baptism services, because there are so many children whose parents are bringing them for baptism, that we were finding that we were having 4 or 5 baptisms a month, which the regular congregation found a little bit daunting as we only have baptisms during services, so we now, once every two or three months are having the newly developed baptism service, which will take the whole of the service, instead of the baptism being part of another service, there is a specific baptism service where the congregation have to take responsibility for the baby and not just the godparents.  So we have spent quite a lot of time discussing if that was the way forward and the conclusion was reached that that was the way forward with the congregation taking full responsibility for the child to be baptised.   So we had 2 or 3 hours discussion on that at PCC meetings.  This month I think we have to discuss whether they still approve of the local ministry team going forward for mandating, have we proved our worth during the last two years and can we go and be mandated in November.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 37.33</B>&#9;What do you attribute the large number of baptisms, is it growth …?</P>
<B><P>A 37.40</B>&#9;It’s growth in the village, we have a number of starter homes I suppose you would call them, and young couples move in and there is a whole estate so therefore we have had quite a lot in the past 2 or 3 years.  A lot of people are quite interestingly concerned about not getting their child baptised.  We also have a very thriving pram service during the week on a Thursday and parents come along with their small children, and from that they do get interested in what’s going on and God might mean something in their lives.  Sometimes it’s generated from that side and sometimes it’s generated from the other side, they want to get their child baptised and they come along to pram service as something that they’ve actually learned from the baptism courses that John’s given them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q38.45</B>&#9;Ann Edwards School was fundamentally a church school…………….is the church still involved?</P>
<B><P>A39.00&#9;</B>The church is still involved, I think it is called a church aided school, but we are still very involved.  John Calvert does assemblies down there about once a month, so he has quite an involvement.  The children come up and do things within the church; sort of history type projects, and we also do a workshop down there once a year and all the publicity for that is given through the school when we have about 110 children come to the workshop and have a super day.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 39.44</B>&#9;………………?</P>
<B><P>A 39.52</B>&#9;We teach them that Advent is preparing for Christmas which isn’t just an occasion where you unwrap lots of presents that cost a lot of money and you don’t play with on Boxing Day, it is about Jesus being born.  We make things with them and we do a sort of nativity type play with them.  Sometimes we make advent calendars with them, do some singing with them, we do all sorts or things relating to the coming of Jesus at Christmas.</P>

<B><P>Q 40.25</B>&#9;In the 19<SUP>th</SUP> Century regulations of Ann Edwards any child who went to chapel and not church was banned from the School.  Does that split still exist?</P>
<B><P>A 40.44</B>&#9;Do it definitely does not exist.  I’ve never heard that one.  It doesn’t even happen within the outside congregation so I’m sure it doesn’t happen within the school.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 41.04</B>&#9;Did your children go to Ann Edwards?</P>
<B><P>A 41.06</B>&#9;My own children went to Ann Edwards, yes.  They were also baptised at All Hallows.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 41.16</B>&#9;Did they benefit from schooling here?</P>
<B><P>A 41.18</B>&#9;Oh yes.  They both enjoyed being at Ann Edwards more than their senior school actually.  In fact my son got me involved with All Hallows Church, bless him.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 41.56</B>&#9;Do you get involved in the graveyard?</P>
<B><P>A 41.58</B>&#9;I haven’t dug a grave yet, but Geoff is wearing out, so I’ve offered to help him. Only if somebody rings up and is trying to trace their family, then sometimes we look to see.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 42.48</B>&#9;How is the churchyard maintained?</P>
<B><P>A 42.52</B>&#9;In the last 2 years the Parish Council has taken over the responsibility of cutting the grass and the general maintenance.  We have this lovely village  digger, I don’t know how long he’s been digging the graves but he always makes it look such an easy job.  There are a number of war graves, which years ago the War Graves Commission used to look after, but that seems to have gone by the way, so they are generally looked after in the general maintenance by the Parish Council.  But because it is the only burial ground in the Parish, the Parish Council take responsibility for it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 43.49</B>&#9;Do you have any people from the Camp?</P>
<B><P>A 43.56</B>&#9;The Camp in itself has it’s own chaplain, which is the vicar of Preston with Siddington, but we do get members of the Camp coming here, and if someone wants to get married here while they are actually on the camp, they get married in South Cerney church, because although the vicar of Preston and Siddington is the chaplain, they are in South Cerney parish, so we marry them.  We do have members of the armed forces in our congregation.  Last week the vicar had a superb thank you letter from a young man who has been up there for a year and he enjoyed his stay at the camp especially coming to All Hallows, so he sent John a lovely letter because he has to leave and go to university, and sent a letter to say how welcome he felt in the congregation of All Hallows Church.</P>

<B><P>Q 45.04</B>&#9;Do you have any appropriations that involve you in the Armistice Day Commemoration?</P>
<B><P>A 45.12</B>&#9;Only in making sure that there will be sufficient leaflets and service sheets and that sport of thing.  The British Legion do the general organisation, I just make sure that we actually have somebody taking the service, the formal bit, I usually organise with the British Legion, with a rehearsal with the vicar on the Saturday morning .</P>

<B><P>Q 45.41</B>&#9;Every year you have a fayre in Church Lane, tell me about that?</P>
<B><P>A 45.58</B>&#9;The Street Fayre started years ago as a craft fayre in the village hall, which I started, and gradually like Topsy, it grew and developed into the Street Fayre, which the first year it was taken over by All Hallows Church it was run by Janice Greenwood, she organised it for a few years, then the last I don’t know how many years I’ve been organising it, but I was hoping to drop it next year.  I’m hoping that I can drop the church bit and I help the chairman of the millennium committee, Peter Jay, actually organise the basics, and the more personal bits and the church bits are organised by somebody else, but I’m doing all the administration, that’s the theory at the moment anyway.  But it’s a huge success the Street Fayre, 1000’s of people come, and it’s a super day.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 47.04</B>&#9;Where do the funds go?</P>
<B><P>A 47.06</B>&#9;The funds this last year, majority of it goes to All Hallows Church, that is the funds that the organising committee raise, so to speak, but a lot of the stall are rented by charities within the village, national charities, and some individuals that do their own craft work.  So they themselves retain their own profit so they just pay the £10 or £15 rental for the stall, and they retain their own profit.  All Hallows Church this year raised nearly £4,500, but on the day I don’t know how much money was actually taken because so many individual groups raise their own funds and I think this year they all did very very well.  </P>

<B><P>Q 47.55</B>&#9;What’s the story about the group that comes from London?</P>
<B><P>A 47.58</B>&#9;Every year a coach load of friends of one of the congregation members; they came the first year and thoroughly enjoyed it, and every year since, that must have been five or six years ago, maybe even longer, have come down from London.  The congregation member concerned has now left the village, moved down to Devon, and has since come back to live in the village again, so there must be a draw somewhere.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 48.39</B>&#9;Who answers questions about genealogy?</P>
<B><P>A 48.42</B>&#9;We get a few letters which depending on how far they want to go back depends where we start looking; sometimes the vicar gives them to me, the idea is, in the future we will have a group of people in the parish who will take over any letters that come in, so they in turn can look through any registers, or direct the people where they need to go, like Gloucester and things like that.  At the moment I’m afraid it is slightly haphazard, if people send a letter, and sometimes it is easy to deal with and others a bit harder.  I’ve got one in the pipeline at the moment, I’ve found the person they want to trace within the burial register we’ve got here, but I can’t find any tombstone anywhere.  I may in turn pass that on to one of the people who have volunteered, although their job has not been made official yet, to see if they can wander round the churchyard and find the tombstone, but I can’t find one in the church maps we’ve got.  Sometimes people like to come and look in their own right, it’s good, but from the point of view of the person who’s got to stay with them while they look through the registers it is very time consuming, and there are fees for actually doing it.</P>
<B><P>A 50.20</B>&#9;Confirmation services are held every year, the usual format nowadays is there is one in the Deanery, not as years ago, when there used to be one in nearly every parish, this coming year 1999, we have the confirmation services in South Cerney, so it is hoping that we can combine all the other celebrations with when the Bishop comes for the confirmation service, which is sometime in May.  People are prepared by the vicar over a number of weeks and preparation depends on whether it’s adults been prepared or children being prepared.  This last year we had 5 or 6 adults, which was rather nice, but no teenagers at all.  But part of the thing is that they have to be regular church members because you can just come along and be confirmed as you can with baptism, but it is part of the feeling that obviously they have got to be members of the congregation and it was nice to have regular members of the congregation being confirmed this year.</P>

<B><P>Q 51.31</B>&#9;What about marriages where people aren’t…………………….?</P>
<B><P>A 51.35</B>&#9;Because we are the church of the parish, the parish church, we are obliged to marry anybody who requests it, if they live within the parish boundaries.  The things that seem to happen now is that people move out and then come back to mum, or the parental home, to be married, which means that there are a lot more marriages by special licence, but even then they have to be shown that in the past they have been a regular member of the congregation, otherwise they have to live in the village and be married by banns which are called on three consecutive Sundays prior to the wedding. </P>
