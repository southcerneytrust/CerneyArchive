</U><P>Q 08.25</B>&#9;&#9;Where do you come from?</P>




<P>A <B>08.35&#9;</B>Where do I come from is a very difficult question to answer, because I was born during the Second World War, and my father was stationed in East Anglia for a few months, so I was born in what was a vicarage but had been turned into an emergency maternity home and it was just outside Downham Market in a little place called Stow Bardolph, and about a year ago, I went to visit this vicarage again, and it turned out that the churchwarden’s son, because we signed our name in the visitor’s book as having gone to see the church and I was born here.  A few weeks later the churchwarden’s son turned up at my vicarage door, and apparently he was a student at the Agricultural College, by pure coincidence and said welcome it’s nice to see you.  So I think my parents were there for six months and then we moved on.  My relatives come from the North East, Sunderland, but most of my life has been spent wandering around various places.  Scarborough as a 5 – 11 year old, primary education.  Secondary education was in Doncaster, then we moved down to Corby in Northamptonshire, where I remember going to my first secondary school assembly there.  I don’t know what it’s called nowadays, but fourth year to me and because it was a lot of Scottish folk come down from Glasgow to work in the steel works, the hymns in assembly were sung with a Scottish accent, and in the middle of Northamptonshire it’s a bit hard to take.  But one soon got used to it, but it was quite startling to start with, and so that was my secondary education, and from there on to Theological College, then a curacy in Central London, just by the Oval Cricket Ground and then one just outside Tunbridge Wells, then we moved to Kettering, Northamptonshire, very near to where I was brought up, within ten miles or so.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 10.56</B>&#9;What was your first impression of South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 10.58&#9;</B>My first impressions were formed before I moved here, because before I became vicar here, I was working for the Diocese of Gloucester as what was called their Children’s Officer, now people used to think that was something to do with adoption, but it wasn’t I was in fact training people who were working with under 12’s.  And  so I came out here occasionally, either to talk to people who were running the Sunday school, I came here as a visiting preacher once in Robert Llewellyn’s time and I ran a course, if I remember rightly, it was a learn to play the guitar course I was running, and I was only about one step in front of everyone else, but I did that in The Lennards for one or two meetings as well.  So I formed an impression of this village as being an interesting place, and an interesting church to be part of.  Now I have to say that is one of the reasons I am here, because I as one went round the diocese doing this particular work, one saw quite a few churches that you thought in the back of your mind, I wouldn’t mind being vicar there, and this is one of them.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 12.10</B>&#9;What was the process of choice?  </P>
<B><P>A 12.13&#9;</B>I wrote to the bishop, when I knew South Cerney was going to be vacant, I expressed an interest, and that is one of the ways in which you can move.  There are other ways, quite often posts are advertised like, say teaching posts.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 12.50</B>&#9;Has your impression of the village changed at all?</P>
<B><P>A 12.54&#9;</B>I wouldn’t say it has improved, I would say it has changed, because I think in the 12 years I’ve been here I have seen changes in the village which has seemed to me as slowly moving away from the old idea of what village community is like to a much wider community, now we are still a pretty close community compared with a town or a city, but I think we are moving towards that anonymity of people, with not the same interest in care and looking after their fellow human beings.  Now we are nowhere near down that negative road, but I think we are a little bit further down that than we were, and I know there are a lot of people here who commute, and see it as a bed and breakfasting place and don’t have any real feel for the community, and the numbers who are being born and bred and lived in the village all their lives, and whose funerals I take, after a lifetime of hardly moving away from this place, the number of those people are going down gradually.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 14.30</B>&#9;Do you think enough is done for them?</P>
<B><P>A 14.34</B>&#9;In a sense there can never be enough done to meet the needs of any sector of the community, so there will be people here who are elderly, who miss out in some way.  Now there are splendid organisations like the COSY Club that I think meet the social needs and give people real friendship and companionship, but of course there are people who in a sense are unclubable and don’t like, who don’t like to go along to those organisations, and slip through the net.  I’m also conscious that there are not just elderly people, but people in social need living in this village, who again slip through the net, because we don’t actually know of them because they are hidden.  So we have a very cosy village community and it is very pleasant, and everybody seems to be happy, but I know beneath the surface there is a degree of unhappiness and hardship.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 15.42</B>&#9;Is there anything we can do about that as a community?</P>
<B><P>A 15.48&#9;</B>It’s very difficult.  For starters people have to say I am in need, and I think if people do open up, and say help I’ve got a problem, then there are sufficient people in this community that genuinely want to help, that will help, but I think the problem is identifying these people, who very often will want to stay quiet and hidden, and I don’t really have an answer to that one.  I suppose it is the grapevine to a certain extent, but that doesn’t always work.  I hear some things very quickly and I don’t hear other things for a long, long time that I would have wanted to know about much earlier.</P>
<B>
<P>Q 16.37</B>&#9;What is your wife’s role?</P>
<B><P>A 16.48</B>&#9;Vicar’s wives have a problem, because the perceived role of the vicar’s wife, thirty, forty or fifty years ago is that she was an unpaid curate and she would be involved in everything.  If I am involved in a ministry, my wife also has a ministry, it happens not to be primarily in this parish, and she is a paid employee of the Diocese of Gloucester, and runs a religious education resource centre, so she is out Tuesday to Friday working a working day and will not for instance, I said to her this morning, Jill, are you going to be in by 6.30 tonight? And she said no, there’s no way I can get back by 6.30, so there are some limitations placed, because if you are doing very important work servicing religious education teachers and people who are working in churches, with all different age groups, and she is doing that from Gloucester.  Whenever she can, which is quite frequently, I have to say, she gets involved with the work here.  In particular the children’s work, because she is an ex-teacher, we are both ex-teachers, and therefore we are both into education, and so she runs our Sunday School, and whenever we put on an event that is for want of a better term, an all-age event, so we have done on All Hallows eve to counteract the negativism and the blackness of Halloween.  We missed last year, but the 11 years before that we have put on a positive celebration for All Hallows eve; well she’s masterminded those kind of things and also a Christmas workshop held down at the school with over 100 children coming to it, again she organises that and gets everybody else involved.  So in those sort of ways, specific ways she gets involved, but the old fashioned idea of the vicar’s wife doing the tea parties with cucumber sandwiches that has gone out of the window, and you would find that if you did a survey of clergy wives up and down the country, you’d find a lot of them would not want to be involved in that kind of work, but would want to be involved in other ways.  And some, I have to say, merely want to be the wife of someone who happens to be a vicar and not be involved in the work at all.  My Jill does not think that way and wants to be involved as much as she can.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 19.30</B>&#9;You are at a rough count the 61<SUP>st</SUP> priest since the 13<SUP>th</SUP> Century, do you find that history weighing a bit heavy?</P>
<B><P>A 19.39</B>&#9;No I’m not really aware of it, I’m very much a here and now person.  I know that the ministry here has got to be to the people in the 1998, 1999, the year 2000 and beyond, and the needs of people, although they are basically the same, we are living in an entirely different age to what we have done in the past and therefore the Christian message, and the way that this is given out, as it were, that needs to be for today.  At the same time, I am conscious for instance when I am doing evensong, which is a service in the 1662 prayer book, but is considerably older than that, and as I walk from the nave up to the chancel to receive the collection at the end of that service, I am often very conscious of being one tiny part of a great long history of this church, this building, the ministry that has gone on in it, and the 1000’s of people that have worshipped in this building and worshipped this God.  1000’s of people have been doing it for years and years.  I’m one small part of that, and it’s a great privilege to be, but at the same time it is life now with all its problems, youngsters without direction, who are possibly getting involved with drugs, and there are many more drug takers in this village than there used to be.  All these kind of issues need to be addressed, but yes I’m one part; life will go on in another 50 years, 100 years, needs will be different, the ministry will be different, the worship may well be different, but it will be the same message.  </P>
<B>
<P>Q 21.52</B>&#9;How do you actually balance the work of all the parishes?</P>
<B><P>A 21.57</B>&#9;With great difficulty, because South Cerney is a very busy village with lots going on, and at the moment we are linked with Down Ampney, which with a population of about 450 still has needs, but they do tend to, because they don’t link with this village, there is no historical link with South Cerney, it has been very difficult to promote active ministry as opposed to just keeping the show on the road as it were, over there, and of course with Cerney Wick, and we will continue to link with Cerney Wick, it is doubtful that we will continue to be linked with Down Ampney.  Down Ampney I think will be linked with places like Marston Meysey and Meysey Hampton.  Possibly Poulton and the Ampneys, but South Cerney and Cerney Wick will forever, I suspect, be linked, but the situation down there is that the number of people who worship in the church there is falling and the community there is altering, in that there are more weekenders, people coming in just to commute and therefore it is more difficult to get living community going because it is such a tiny hamlet.  So lots happening here, quite difficult to give Down Ampney a fair crack of the whip, because so much is happening here.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 23.33</B>&#9;……………Joan Tranter ………………………?</P>
<B><P>A 23.41</B>&#9;Amazing.  What can I say?  Joan Tranter;  I don’t know how many years she has been sacristan, or how many years she has been closely involved with this church, I suspect as many years as she has been in this village, which is 20 odd, probably nearer 30, and Joan Tranter spends an amazing amount of time working for this church.  Looking after the organisation of services before they take place, being involved in the pram service, and she has been closely involved with Mothers’ Union, and still is a member, but she has been an enrolling member for many years, and is very much a right hand person. Wonderful, the Church of England at its best.  Joan Townsend, who at the moment is Parish Administrator, and has been for 4 or 5 years now is amazing in that if I give her a list of 20 jobs, thinking that it will take her about a week to do, she will have it done by the end of the morning.  She has an amazing capacity to get through work, and she knows the village well, as well and so knows a lot more about the history of people than I do.  I know a fair bit now, but she knows a lot more because she has been here 25 years or so, and with both of these people really they are essential to the work going on.  And people probably do not realise the amount of paperwork that lands on the desk.  I have been on holiday, I have only just returned, but the pile was about that high, and it has take several hours just to open the letters and decide whether they are worth dealing with and how they should be dealt with and people like Joan Townsend will deal with a lot of that material, and deal with routine forms that have to be filled in, which allows me to get on with some of the other work.  At the same time, I am very conscious of the fact that I am only scratching the surface of the spiritual and the emotional, educational and social needs of this village as well.  So there is a lot of work that needs to be done.  Can I also say that the things that has to be got hold of by the church and also the community that it isn’t the vicar that does the ministry, but the church people, so that we are working towards having a ministry team comprising of myself and lay readers, but also lay people, ordinary people in the pews that have been chosen by the PCC to be more involved with ministry and me with these other folk forming the local ministry team.  I also have the task of encouraging the rest of the congregation to be involved in ministry.  We were talking earlier on about identifying people in need; if we’ve got 100 people in this church identifying people in need and befriending them, then that’s a lot more effective than one clergyman doing that.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 28.12</B>&#9;What are the problems of the fabric and security……..?</P>
<B><P>A 28.17</B>&#9;The problems of the fabric of the church; the church is in good condition it is well looked after, we have minor problems, a leak here, a leak there, a bit of lead that needs relaying, but this church is in good condition and has been well looked after in the past. We have had a little bit of petty vandalism, my guess is that it is some teenagers, with nothing better to do in the evening, so decided to come and scrawl on walls.  We had a sound system in the past a sound system that was sounding it’s age, but there were lots of loudspeaker wires around and these youngsters came and cut these wire regularly.  Now we have used modern technology to help prevent that, one of which is that we have put a new sound system in which means there are not so many wires knocking around, we are on radio mikes and we have got loudspeakers that are feet and feet away out of reach, but also we have  closed circuit television cameras in so that the church is covered if there is any hanky panky going on, we can observe it and it is recorded and so we can play the tape back if we need to, we don’t play the tape back unless it is absolutely necessary.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 30.00</B>&#9;The very beautiful head and foot of Christ is one of the great glories of the history of the church, how did it get…………?</P>
<B><P>A 30.14</B>&#9;The head and foot, that is a replica, and the original is in the British Museum and we are told it is priceless, although we were able to sell it to the British Museum for £60,000 in 1996.  It is priceless because it is the only example existing of what is left of a mediaeval crucifix, and just about every church in the land would have had its crucifix on the rood screen across the chancel and all of these disappeared and the guess is that someone either took the whole crucifix and hid it or perhaps cut off the  head and feet and hands and hid those essential parts of the crucifix in the wall of the church and at the beginning of the century of the century they were discovered when some work was being done on the tower, I believe, and these fragments were found, and were recognised as important at the time, but as time has gone on that they are recognised as a national treasure.  About 20 years ago, perhaps longer, these were loaned for a Romanesque exhibition in the Hayward Gallery in London, put on by the Arts Council, and part as of the deal, I believe, they were conserved and also we had made for us this replica, which is a very good replica of the originals.  The British Museum then said can we hold on to them, and that was probably part of the deal, and they remained in the British Museum for many years, and I think the British Museum has always been a little bit concerned about their future, because they knew that the head and foot didn’t belong to them, and at the same time we realised that we could never have the head and foot back because of the special conditions we would have to provide were not on financially, nor could we do the daily routine of work that is required, such as checking the temperature and humidity and the safety of them, and so we came to an agreement that for the figure that the head and foot was insured, which was £60,000, that the British Museum would buy the fragments on a closed deal.  Had it been on the open market who knows what they would have fetched, but we would never been allowed to put them on the open market nor would we have wanted to, because the danger would have been that they might have gone oversees, and we certainly wouldn’t have wanted that.  The Church Council are certainly very happy that they are residing permanently in the British Museum, because they are a national treasure and I think that is the right place for them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 33.58</B>&#9;Are you, as the vicar a trustee of Ann Edwards School or Cutts charity?</P>
<B><P>A 34.08</B>&#9;I am an ex-officio governor of Ann Edwards School, because it is a Church controlled school, so I have quite a lot to do with the school; it means attending governors’ meetings, which 20 – 30 years ago, was an absolute doddle, the vicar was usually chairman of the governors, and he went along once a term, or twice a term for a meeting, but that’s all that used to happen.  Nowadays we are very much managing the school, and the governors have statutory responsibilities and can be legally liable if they make a mess of things, so it is a whole new ball game.  I have been chairman of the governors, I’m now not, I’m just one of the governors and we are actually going through this process at this very moment of choosing anew head teacher, it is complicated and has to be done very carefully.  But the governors are responsible for the finance, for the managing of the school generally and making sure that a head teacher and his or her staff meet their responsibilities adequately.  We can hire and fire, and we don’t, we certainly don’t want and haven’t got to.  The Cutts charity, I thing I’m not on ex-officio, I am simply on because I was asked to be on, but there could be a time when the local vicar isn’t on.  I think one of the useful things about having the vicar on is that there might be needs he knows about, that might prove useful.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 36.12</B>&#9;What about the ecumenical side of side of the church?</P>
<B><P>A 36.18</B>&#9;The ecumenical side of things is very interesting and very exciting, but I think a lengthy process.  I think we did have the active church that has been here for centuries, we did have a brethren meeting house in times past, a Methodist church and a congregational church.  The brethren assembly stopped meeting I don’t know how many years ago, ancient history, maybe 30 years ago or more.  The Methodist church was sold off as a house about 20 years ago, and so the non-conformist church in the village called the United church and is a congregational building, but the ministry is organised by the Methodist church circuit, so there is a small congregation, which is on the whole elderly, but has actually got one or two younger members coming in now.  Four years ago in 1994, July 1994, we entered into a sharing agreement with the United Church, on the use of their buildings.  Next to the chapel there is what I assume was a cottage, and downstairs has been a meeting room in recent years and has been well used and upstairs was derelict.  We put some money into refurbishing the upstairs, we have carpeted downstairs, we’ve put some storage heaters in, so we have got the whole of that cottage building that is next to the church in operation.  The top floor is the church office and a small meeting room, where you can meet with perhaps 6 or 7 people. And downstairs there is a larger room where on could have 25 people.  In recent years, in the last decade, because of rot, the chapel has had to take its pews out and so they have put a concrete floor door it’s carpeted and they have got comfortable chairs, and that’s made that into a very pleasant chapel to worship in, but also a very useful building that can be used for all kinds of things.  So what has happened in the last then years is that the chapel has moved from just being a chapel with a small meeting room next to it, to a chapel that can be a dual purpose building, that’s comfortable, and we are working on making the heating better, and then it’s also moved to being a church office so that from our church point of view, we are stuck down a side road, we have got a more central image, which is very useful as well.  We are hoping that as time goes on, these two congregations can begin to work together more, and that is what we are talking about at the moment, and I expect 10 years down the line there will be many more joint activities going on.</P>
<B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Q 39.32</B>&#9;What is the link with Wesley?</P>
<B><P>A 39.44</B>&#9;The link that I know of is that his portrait is hanging on the wall.  I think Wesley is there as the patron saint as Methodism.  </P>
<B><P>A 40.19</B>&#9;People may see me as the vicar, but music is also a very important part of my life.  In my ministry in the past I have not used music particularly, but as I said earlier, I was one step ahead on playing the guitar.  When I was a curate I was actually known locally as the guitar-playing curate in the 1960’s.   I have been a bit of a pianist in the past, I’m not much good at it now I hasten to add.  Music is important, of my five senses, the sense of sound is the most acute in me as a person, so I learned music and I’ve got a great interest in Vaughan Williams, which is a very interesting coincidence as I am vicar not only of South Cerney with Cerney Wick, but also Down Ampney, where Vaughan Williams was born, and he for many years was my favourite composer, and still is, so I love his music very much, and to end up being the vicar of Down Ampney, which like hundreds of people each year, about 15 years ago, I did the Vaughan Williams pilgrimage,  turned off the A419 and turned into the village to see where he was born.   So that aspect is important to me, and I’ve done a little bit of music working with the choir and we are working towards putting on a musical this Christmas.  We did one a couple of years ago, which was very successful at Christmastime, and we are beginning this Friday on the next musical, which we hope will be just as successful.</P>

<B><P>Q 42.14</B>&#9;I haven’t asked you what part the younger people play in worship here? </P>
<B><P>A 42.18</B>&#9;Our work with young people, we consider very important, and what we try and do is provide an environment where young people will feel happy.  Now I’ll start with the tinies and move up; we have got a pram service at the moment, which happens twice a month on a Thursday, 15 minute service maximum, it may go on, it might only be 10 minutes sometimes, where pre-school children will move about and do some action rhymes and songs with them, I show them some pictures and we’ll talk about some objects, and that is a superb introduction to church, because it gets some of these mums coming in with tiny babies, some of them are pregnant one week and go away and have the baby and come back to the next pram service with a tiny baby, so we are dealing with sometimes very young children, right up to four year olds, when they are ready to go to school.  And if it does nothing else, is gives a young child the chance to get a feel of this building, which is probably the largest building in their experience.  In a normal 12 by 12 sitting room or whatever at home and suddenly you are presented with this very large echoey building, then it can be quite strange to a child, and so at a very basic level it helps a young child get used to that, and it gets used to what the pews are for and you will notice that when playgroup comes in, if some of our pram service children are going to playgroup, they will automatically know what is going to happen and feel at home.  So I think that is a very important introduction.  Our slightly older children, trekkers, we call it at the minute, so we are talking about the 5 – 9’s, they will meet around at the United church for most of the duration of the morning service, and then come in for part of our service.  So they’ve got their own activities, but they are also part of the church, I think the problem with having your separate, 2.30 in the afternoon, Sunday School, which we had in the past, and very successful they were at the time, but one of the problems with that is that it does give the feeling that there are not part of the church, and I think it is important for adults to recognise that children are part of the church and their membership is just as important as and adults, so that’s the way we work at the minute.  When you get older still we have got a fortnightly meeting for 9 – 13 year olds, they meet at Atkyns Manor at the moment on a Sunday evening, and also if they are coming to church on a Sunday morning they will go up to the clergy vestry during the sermon for about 20 minutes or so for teaching.  The sermon doesn’t last 20 minutes but they stay out a little bit longer than the sermon.  Then we come to our teenage work, which at the moment is difficult, you know what teenagers are like, we’ve all been through it.  If you’ve been coming to church for years you decide that it’s now time you left, because you’re growing up and you’re not going to have anything to do with it, and we acknowledge that, and that is part of the process, so we try and keep tabs on these older youngsters by an occasional meeting, if we possibly can.  And the church is also responsible for a village youth club on a Friday evening, which is doing very valuable work with some of the youngsters who certainly wouldn’t be seen dead in church, but still have needs that they want to meet together and socialise, but also just occasionally want to talk about serious things, and so we provide a venue for that.</P>

<B><P>Q 26.26</B>&#9;You were telling me that you have a number of……………….?</P>
<B><P>A 46.36</B>&#9;As I was saying earlier, at evensong, I sometimes feel part of this centuries old tradition that has been going on here, and I’m conscious when I take a funeral, particularly of people who have been important in this community or people who haven’t done anything up front, but have been around for 80 years, hardly leaving the village.  I’m very aware that they are part of the community and the memories and the experience and their life story is important and that carries on.  What I try to do in a funeral is in a formal way give an account of what part they played and the persons they have been for this community, and over the years in recent years, when I’ve had a computer to keep the material, I thought it would be useful to make a more permanent record of that because it is still on the hard disk somewhere.</P>

<B><P>Q 47.44</B>&#9;Do you think it is important ……………..?</P>
<B><P>A 47.48</B>&#9;Yes.  Because I’m just getting into my family tree, you know as one gets older they get interested in their family tree, and I’ve reached that age.  I’m very conscious of this, I want to look back and see where my roots lie, and I think this village wants to do the same, many people, to look back and see what it was like in the late 20<SUP>th</SUP> century.  I think if you know where you are coming from it gives you some sense of direction as to where you are going as well, so here we are in the late 20<SUP>th</SUP> century, I suppose giving a picture of this is South Cerney in 1998, 1999, 2000, and maybe that will help people in a century’s time.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 49.36</B>&#9;………………………?</P>
<B><P>A 49.55</B>&#9;One of the very important people in this community is someone called Cyril Stephens, whose funeral I took about a year ago in October1997, and he lived in the village all his life, he was very much part of this community, and I remember what I wrote for his funeral, I started by saying no more flowers for sale outside Orchis, that's the name of his house, no more of the gentle puffing and panting as he peddled his bicycle up and down the street, and that was one of his trademarks, he was a great village character, but one of the important things that he did was form this Flower Class Corvette Association, he like hundreds of other men served on Corvettes during the Second World War, and a lot of them were named after flowers, and one of them was called Orchis, and he named his house after that.  And in recent years he formed an organisation to get some of these men back together once a year, which ten became twice a year, and they used to have a service in May in Leamington and a service here in South Cerney in September of each year, so we had one about a month ago, and there would have been about 80 men who served on those ships came here for evensong, had a cup of tea and a chat and a good reunion as they always do, in the village hall, and then went their way.  And of course in a year’s time some of them will not be returning because they will have passed on, because all of them are well into their 70’s and 80’s and Cyril, who we expected to go on year after year, died about 3 weeks after last year’s reunion service.  So this year’s was sad, because it was the first one without Cyril.</P>
