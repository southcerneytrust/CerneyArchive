<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 00.05&#9;&#9;</B>What is your name and where were you born?</P>




<B><P>A 00.07</B>&#9;I’m Brian Milner and I was born in India, my father was an RSM in the Artillery.</P>

<B><P>Q 00.21</B>&#9;And when did you come back?</P>
<B><P>A 00.23</B>&#9;I went all over the world before I eventually came to the UK.  Came back when I was 6, and lived in various parts of the country because dad was in the Army and eventually ended up in the Forest of Dean, which is the home of my mother and family.</P>

<B><P>Q 00.53</B>&#9;When did you come to South Cerney?</P>
<B><P>A 01.01</B>&#9;When I joined the Police Force I transferred from Lydney to Cirencester and spent some time on the beat in Cirencester and on traffic, but I actually moved into my own house in Meadow Way in South Cerney in 1971, and then in 1974 I came across into South Cerney as an officer.</P>

<B><P>Q 01.30</B>&#9;How many officers were there….?</P>
<B><P>A 01.33</B>&#9;At the time there was one PC in charge, who actually lived the in the police house, and due to a lot of problems in one of the outlying villages it was decided to bring me into South Cerney as what they call the second man and basically my instructions were to sort out one village, it wasn’t South Cerney believe it or not, which was done and dealt with and after that I stayed at South Cerney for 18 years apart from one brief break.</P>

<B><P>Q 02.09</B>&#9;Do you notice any difference from when you first came…….?</P>
<B><P>A 02.20</B>&#9;When I first came it was only a small village obviously, it hadn’t expanded the way it has.  I watched it develop over the 18 years, particularly the Water Park, and when I finished it was a very pleasant sort of area to live in to be honest.</P>

<B><P>Q 02.42</B>&#9;What about the crime variation?</P>
<B><P>A 02.48</B>&#9;What during my period in South Cerney? I mainly found my crime was in the Water Park, the clubhouses, the more remote places, the quarries.  The villages didn’t have the sort of crime that we have now; the main thing was as well there was always a high profile policing of the villages, well all around, but it was mostly the clubhouses and the lakes.</P>

<B><P>Q 03.20</B>&#9;Is there any variation in the age of people involved?</P>
<B><P>A 03.26</B>&#9;Again when I was in the job it was 18 and upwards that were doing all the crime, definitely not our South Cerney lads or any other local lads to be honest they were as good as gold even though I used to chase them fairish.  They would come in from outside to do crime, generally that was their mistake, because they tended to think that the Water Park and villages didn’t have police officers, all the policemen were in town, so that was to my advantage.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 04.03</B>&#9;What happened when you left…..?</P>
<B><P>A 04.13</B>&#9;Well funny enough I’m involved in work now and virtually all of the crime is committed by youngsters, aged 16 and under, and that’s borne out by the fact that I travel all over the country taking these youngsters, anything from 11 years of age to 16, and all in very serious crime.</P>

<B><P>Q 04.38</B>&#9;What do you think the cause is………..?</P>
<B><P>A 04.45</B>&#9;I know everyone says it, but it is a lack of personal contact by police officers, I’ve got no doubt about that, virtually all the youngsters that are in trouble now in this village were young people when I was dealing with them, and they were approachable, you could go and speak to them or if you had to chase them, but they appreciated it, and when I speak to them now basically they say that if they were chased early on they wouldn’t commit any crime, that’ snot happening by the looks of it.</P>

<B><P>Q 05.27</B>&#9;Do you think parents…….?</P>
<B><P>A 05.34</B>&#9;In some cases, but I’ve also seen some good parents totally in despair, because you’ve only got to get a decent young person getting mixed up with a bad one and it is like a rotten apple it affects them all and that’s it.</P>

<B><P>Q 05.58</B>&#9;Do they keep together in their siblings……?</P>
<B><P>A 06.04</B>&#9;Well usually there is an older person amongst them, an older young person, I always consider most of them I’ve seen are inadequates, they can’t really impress anyone of their own age or older, so they latch on to the 12, 13, 14 year olds, because then they’ll be the hero.</P>

<B><P>Q 06.35</B>&#9;How high was the crime rate compared with South Cerney…..?</P>
<B><P>A 06.48</B>&#9;South Cerney I pride myself that I had possibly the lowest crime rate in the County, but that was all due to what I call high profile policing, so they saw me, I would appear just about anywhere and everywhere at anytime, the youngsters used to laugh about it, I would suddenly come out of a bush, but I think the thing was to be seen, because whatever criminal, no matter how stupid he is if he sees a vehicle moving, a police vehicle moving around it’s not good news for him.</P>

<B><P>Q 07.30</B>&#9;And now?</P>
<B><P>A 07.33</B>&#9;Rather disappointed now, we seem to have more and more our own page of crime in the Standard now, every week there’s somewhere in South Cerney that’s been broken in to or a vehicle broken into, and I feel possibly, I don’t know what the situation is now in South Cerney as regards policing, but a lot more foot patrols and much more presence I think would have helped.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 08.16</B>&#9;……in your time?</P>
<B><P>A 08.18</B>&#9;In the time I was here I don’t think there was any youngster in the village who went to court on what I call a criminal matter.  The numerous ones were the road traffic ones, but the thing was to get to them quickly if I could.  And if I could with some of them, say the bus shelter was damaged, all right that was criminal damage, but instead of booking them I made them paint the bus shelter out.  The Chief Superintendent did ask me what police manual I was working to.  But it worked and funnily enough you keep the respect of the young people and that is very important.</P>

<B><P>Q 09.08</B>&#9;……Social workers and things……….?</P>
<B><P>A 09.19</B>&#9;I work with a lot of social workers, almost daily now, I’ve gone completely from one mental approach to crime in young people to completely the other way, but it’s not the social workers, it is the system, whereby their hands are tied to such an extent they can’t do a thing with them.  I deal with young people, up to the age of 16 all the time.  I’ve had them for attempted murder, burglaries, you name the crime and they’ve committed it, but right along the board they’ve all responded to discipline and unfortunately, there is nobody with the authority to apply the discipline, we apply it in the period we’ve got them and they respond very well to it, but at the end of the day young people want to know who is boss, who’s in charge, and if we stand back and let them be in charge this is the reason we’ve got all this crime.</P>

<B><P>Q 10.39</B>&#9;When you were at South Cerney did you visit Ann Edwards’ School to liaise with the children?</P>
<B><P>A 10.45</B>&#9;Yes, I visited all the schools round here, because I had 9 villages, so I visited all of those and I enjoyed it.  What I enjoyed;  I made sure every tour of duty, unless workload dictated otherwise,  I always gave myself an hour or two hours foot patrol.  Usually one day it would be the top part of the village and the next day the bottom, but that’s where I met people, talked to people, heard things.  And that’s what it’s all about, it’s communicating with the local people, and that is sadly lacking I’m afraid now.</P>

<B><P>Q 11.34</B>&#9;How many police officers……….now?</P>
<B><P>A 11.40</B>&#9;I understand that there are two in South Cerney, but I’ve got a funny feeling that probably they are dragged away from here all the time to work in other areas.  My feeling is that I don’t think there is anymore important area for them to police than South Cerney. We’re a small community, why should we be put second to Cirencester, or anywhere else?  One thing that does annoy me even now that is reading about speeding motorists being chased and a comment by a police officer that I will stop them at 31 miles an hour.  My feelings are get out of the car, put your top hat on and walk, let’s leave the speeding for the time being and get the crime sorted.  But I’m not in charge.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 12.42</B>&#9;Has the extension to the bypass on the A419 made any difference?</P>
<B><P>A 12.52</B>&#9;As far as I’m concerned, I think the bypass is one of the best things that could have happened, it has taken a lot of traffic out and made it much safer on the main Swindon/Gloucester Road.  Again, I travel it almost daily at all times of the night and day, and I think it’s done nothing but good, we certainly don’t get anything like the traffic or the accidents, I don’t think now that we were getting 12 months ago.</P>

<B><P>Q 13.36</B>&#9;Is there any evidence that……………..?</P>
<B><P>A 13.40</B>&#9;On that side of it I don’t know, I would have thought probably not, because it is bypassing South Cerney now.  When I was on patrol I very often used to park down on the Spine Road near the junction, and pick them up as they were coming in.  Of course, it’s like all motorists now, they have got a straight road ahead of them and they stop for nothing, so possibly the next time they stop it’s going to be Gloucester, but that doesn’t worry us too much.</P>

<B><P>Q 14.18</B>&#9;Inaudible question</P>
<B><P>A 14.25</B>&#9;Well the drugs were just starting to creep in in the last possibly 6 to 12 months of my tour of duty, which was 5 years ago now, we had our drug problem in South Cerney at a certain pub, but fortunately our young people weren’t involved I it and I used to spend a lot of time there, and I made quite a few arrests, not out of the pub itself, but when they were coming out or going in, possession of drugs.  The pub’s not there anymore, but I think we’ve got quite an horrendous drug problem in South Cerney, because I do talk to a lot of the youngsters and the parents of them, but that is throughout the country quite honestly.  All the young people that I deal with on escort work, every one of them is on drugs, and some of them on quite hard drugs too.</P>

<B><P>Q 15.32</B>&#9;Have you any suggestions, ways of………..?</P>
<B><P>A 15.41</B>&#9;I don’t think there is the manpower to stop it; it’s got such a grip now that I just don’t think there is the manpower to do it.  I think possibly again in villages like South Cerney, if we had an intense police presence which we had at one time, possibly you could curb it to a certain extent, but I’m under no illusions that drugs have really got a grip in the country now with young people.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 16.24</B>&#9;What do you thin the psychology……………….?</P>
<B><P>A 16.29&#9;</B>The ringleaders quite honest, as I’ve said are total inadequates, generally speaking you find they are unemployed, they are unemployable because they’re bone idle they are just completely stupid, but they do take on.  Young people now are easily led, it’s a case of well if you do this, there’s enough money there for a CD or if you pinch a radio I’ll get you £20 for it, and there’s all that sort of thing, but they could be channelled in a totally different direction and keep out of trouble, but they need to be got at early.  I used to make them clear all the litter up around the bus shelter.  I would wait for one to drop a cigarette packet, then go over, and they would clear the lot up.  It was begrudgingly done, agreed, but they did it and then in the end there’d be nothing, and one or two of the ones that are in serious trouble now in the village used to knock on the office door in the evening when I was doing my office work and say Mr Milner, can we have a sweeping brush and a shovel.  Why? Because the bus shelter is in a right state.  We know that when you come out you will either make us clear it up and then go home, but if we clear and tidy it up now, can we sit in the bus shelter?  And it was the only place in the village they could go at that time.  They used to sit there, they’d have their arguments and that, but as long as they kept it pretty clean and kept the foul language down.  I don’t know what’s happened to them now, I far enough away not to worry too much at the moment.</P>

<B><P>Q 18.28</B>&#9;Do you think there is an element of bullying?</P>
<B><P>A 18.30</B>&#9;I don’t think it’s bullying, I think in a lot of ways they are waiting to be led.  And these people are good at it, who are doing it, they have had plenty of practice.</P>

<B><P>Q 19.00</B>&#9;…….when you were working here?</P>
<B><P>A 19.02</B>&#9;Once I’d established myself here, I was given a total free hand on my duties, which was almost unheard of anywhere else, but if I heard that certain things were happening on a Tuesday morning at 1.00am, then my duties would be accordingly changed, but I was never given any duties from Cirencester.  I just submitted my own duty sheets to suit whatever the requirements were in the village.  I can remember one senior officer from another division, I walked into Cirencester police station at 2 o’clock one morning and he said are you working here tonight, and I said No, South Cerney,  He said but it’s 2 o’clock, what are you doing working at 2 o’clock?  I said well I normally work until 2 or 3 on a weekend anyway, and he aid you’re joking, and I had to show him my duty sheets to show him that I did, but I loved it at that time in the morning, that’s when you saw and heard things.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Q 20.30</B>&#9;Anything you can tell me about …….?</P>
<B><P>A 20.37</B>&#9;Yes, I can remember that at one time we kept what was called an occurrence book, and I was reading through those because they were never to be destroyed or disposed of, and I used to read those and it was quite interesting. Some of the prominent names of the village that appeared in those for riding bikes without lights, failing to black out the windows during the war.  There were so many funny little offences they were all booked for.  There was a PC Spence, and funnily enough I met him the other day and we were chatting, but he received the George Medal and another PC when a chap went berserk in Down Ampney some years ago. Spence was shot I believe he’s still got the bullet in him, so South Cerney isn’t the quiet little backwater that everybody thought it was.</P>
