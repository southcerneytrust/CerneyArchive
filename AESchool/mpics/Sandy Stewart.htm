<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=4><P>We went up another lane which took us to River Way and then we went up another lane that took us to School Lane and the Village Hall. We went down the road to the old school and we had 15 seconds to pick up conkers there. We crossed Silver Street and went up Church Lane to look at the Manor House. It has proper corner pieces called quoins. We went past the allotments, down to Bow-Wow and saw the Lower Mill. We walked down to Box Bush Road and along Station Road to get back to school.</P>
