<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=4><P>On Tuesday 13t October the Rev. Calvert visited our class. The church is eleven hundred years old and it's where people go to have their children christened. The child goes in a font and has water put on his head. Funerals are when people die and they are put in a fire or you can be buried under the ground. Weddings are when people get married. The vicar wears a white cassock, a dog collar, a girdle and a stole for christenings, weddings and communion. A communion service is when people have bread and wine. They have Easter, Harvest and Christmas services too.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=4><P>On Tuesday 13<SUP>th</SUP> October the Rev. Calvert visited our class. He came to tell us about the church and the services he has there. The church is over a thousand years old. It is a cross from a bird's eye view. At the end of the guttering there is a gargoyle to frighten evil spirits away. To tell the time they look at a sundial on the outside of the church.</P>
