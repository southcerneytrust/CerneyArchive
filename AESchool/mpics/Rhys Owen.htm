<FONT FACE="Kidprint" SIZE=5><P>Then we went almost left and straight on to School Lane where we saw the Uppermill that was burnt down and then rebuilt in 1980. A mill has been there for 1,000 years. We went to the old school and we saw the person in charge of it. He said we could go around and collect conkers. Then we went to the church, past the church to the bowling green and after the bridge we went straight on down an alley, then left and straight on back to school.</P>
