<P>We first walked down Berkeley Close and stopped at the post box and the phone box. Mr Woodford, the photographer, noticed that the crowns were different. On the post box there was the Queen Elizabeth's crown and on the phone box was King George's crown. Then we went to the War Memorial. On it were the names of people who had died in the war. We walked up the alleyway to Meadow Way and we stopped at the River Churn and had a look at the houses. A man came and told us about the mill. The mill was used for two things. One was a sawmill and the other was a woollen mill. The cottages opposite were four hundred years old and they had gargoyles on them. We went to the Village Hall, which has a thatched roof. It has chicken wire to stop birds from taking the straw ad mice and rats from going inside it. We went to the old school ad we could see some of the names of the people who went there. We could also see the hole where the school bell was. We went past the church, along a path and came to a bridge. We bent down and we could see where the water went down into the mill. We carried on walking and ended up at Station Road and went to the other cross. It does look like the other one but the cross is different because it is made out of metal. After that it was back to school.</P>

On our visit round South Cerney we saw several gargoyles on some of the older cottages and on All Hallows Church. It is said that in olden times they frightened evil spirits away.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=4><P>On Monday 28<SUP>th</SUP> September we went for a walk around the village. When we got to the end of Berkeley Close we looked at the phone box and the post box. The post box has Queen Elizabeth's crown on and the phone box has King George's crown on. We went past Londis on to the first cross. At the first cross there are some flower holders for poppies. Then we went down a path to Meadow Way. After that we went down another path that led to School Lane. At the top of School Lane a man came out of his house and told us about Upper Mill. He told us that there had been a mill there for over a thousand years. Then we stopped at the Village Hall. It has a thatched roof which has netting over to stop mice and birds nesting in the straw. Next we came to the old school and we went round the back where we picked conkers. We crossed the road and we were in Church Lane. There are some old houses in Church Lane. We walked past the gardens and the bowling green. We crossed the bridge by the Lower Mill and then we came down a path that led to Station Road. At the second cross we stopped and looked at it, then we came back to school.</P>
