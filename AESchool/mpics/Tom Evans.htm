<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=4><P>The font is a stone bowl used to hold water. It is used to get christened in. When a person has been christened they are given a Christian first name. The font is at the west end of the church near the main entrance. There is a big piece of wood that is used to cover over the top of the font and the lid is locked down. In the old days people thought that the water had magic powers and they kept the font locked so that the water couldn't get stolen.</P>
