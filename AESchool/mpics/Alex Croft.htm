<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=4><P>We turned left to the War Memorial and we went up the path behind Jubilee Gardens. We walked up the path and across the road to another path. In School Lane we saw Uppermill House. A man said that the old house got burnt down and a new one was built using the old stones. When we got to the old school a man said we could have a look round the back. There were lots of conkers. We walked across Bow-Wow and back to school.</P>
