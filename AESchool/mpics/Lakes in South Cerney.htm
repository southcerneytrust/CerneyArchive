<P>Lakes in South Cerney</P>
<P>The lakes got there because they took the gravel out. They got deep enough that they hit the water table. The water came in and the rainwater came in and it takes months to fill a lake. At the lakes the services are at the Watermark and Lake 15 on Station Road and other lakes:</P>
<P>Skiing</P>
<P>Jumping</P>
<P>Slaloming</P>
<P>Kneeboarding</P>
<P>Banana boat riding</P>
<P>Swimming</P>
<P>Canoeing</P>
<P>Exercising</P>
<P>Fishing</P>
<P>Sailing</P>
<P>Country park</P>
<P>Caravan sites</P>
<P>Lodges</P>

<P>I will now tell you all the lakes in South Cerney I know: Cotswold lake, Watermark, Sailing lake, Isis Sailing Club, Jetski lake, Fisherman's Rest, Andy's Lake and Outdoor Education Centre.</P>
<P>The Cotswold Lake was dug in the 1960's. It used to be a field that my playgroup teacher, Mrs Chapman, used to walk across.</P>
<P>The Watermark was built in 1992 when they joined lakes 14 and 15 together.</P>
<P>Andy's Lake was named Andy's Lake because his parents bought it in memory of him.</P>
