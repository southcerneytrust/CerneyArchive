<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=4><P>On Monday 9<SUP>th</SUP> November the Y4's in Mr Nicholas's class visited Atkyns Manor. Mr Fenton opened the door. It had pillars and someone asked how old they were. Mr Fenton answered " That is a very good question. These pillars are over 2,000 years old. They were found in the garden and they are Roman." When he had finished speaking about the pillars I asked how old the house was. He said, "We don't really know. About 500 years old." It was a very large house. The house has a well full of water underneath the kitchen.</P>

<P>On Monday 9<SUP>th</SUP> of November we went to Atkyns Manor. The pillars in Atkyns Manor are very old. They are over 2,000 years old and there are plaster patterns in the ceiling. Atkyns Manor is very old and Mr Fenton has lived there for 57 years. There is a fishpond in the garden but we couldn't see the fish.</P>

<P>When we came through the front door we came to a room with two Roman pillars holding up the roof. There are six Roman pillars and they are about two thousand years old. Mr Fenton's family has lived in Atkyns Manor for ninety-two years. There are some marks on a Roman pillar in the kitchen because a man pulled a pump and it scraped against the pillar. Upstairs there is a window that has some writing on it. This is what it says: "A chase horse named Tharper is buried in a courtyard beneath this window."</P>

<P>On Monday 9<SUP>th</SUP> November we went to Atkyns Manor and we discovered that parts of the house are over 300 years old. In the hall they have got two Roman pillars and they are over 2000 years old. There is some very old plaster and it is over 500 years old. A chase horse called Tharper is 32 years old and he is buried under a window with some writing on it describing Tharper. There is a chest and it is 300 years old and it is a reminder of Matthew Nicholas and the date on it was 1683.</P>
<P>Before mains water came into South Cerney there was a well and a man used to come in and pump the big handle.</P>
