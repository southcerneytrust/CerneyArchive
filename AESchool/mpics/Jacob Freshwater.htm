<FONT FACE="Maiandra GD" SIZE=4><P>We went up the path to River Way. We crossed the road and continued down the path until we came to School Lane. We saw the old mill which was burned down and then rebuilt in 1980 with the old stones. There has been a mill here for 1000 years. We crossed the road at the ford and came to the Village Hall. We continued down School lane to the old school. We went round to the back of the school and got a load of conkers. We went down to the end and crossed Silver Street and went up Church Lane to All Hallow's Church. We found out that the buildings around the church are quite old. We went down a path, past the orchard, through the kissing gate and past the bowling green, through another kissing gate and on to Bow-Wow, across the bridge and down the path to Station Road. We walked down to Clark's Hay and back to school.</P>
