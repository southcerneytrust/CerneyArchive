<FONT FACE="Lucida Casual" SIZE=4><P>One day Isaac went to church in Cirencester. It was raining when he got to church and he was so wet he caught a cold and died. Before 1820 Ann Edwards ran a Dame School. After her husband died she gave the money to build a new school, she bought a clock for the church and she paid all her father's debts. She died in 1834 and some of the money she left paid for the building of Edwards College.</P>
