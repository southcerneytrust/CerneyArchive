<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=4><P>Mrs Ann Edwards was left a large amount of money which she used to build the school. She also gave money to charity. She died in 1834. Twelve houses were built for distressed families of clergymen, as she was the widow of a curate. This is known as Edwards College.</P>
