<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=4><P>This house is called Bridge House because it's next to the bridge. The river that goes under the bridge is called the River Churn. There is a stone and chain fence outside and I think it's for decoration. This is the oldest house in the village. The gargoyles above the front door were to scare away the devils. I think there was a grocery shop here before it was a house.</P>
